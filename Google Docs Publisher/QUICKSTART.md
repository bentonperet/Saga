#### Step 2: Download Your Credentials

**This is the only technical file you need to download!**

   - Go to **"APIs & Services"** ‚Üí **"Credentials"** (in left sidebar)
   - Click the blue **"+ CREATE CREDENTIALS"** button at the top
   - Choose **"OAuth client ID"**

2. **First time? Configure consent screen**
   - If prompted, click **"CONFIGURE CONSENT SCREEN"**
   - Choose **"External"** ‚Üí Click **"CREATE"**
   - Fill in:
     - App name: `Obsidian Publisher`
     - User support email: (your email)
     - Developer contact: (your email again)
   - Click **"SAVE AND CONTINUE"** through all screens (you can skip optional fields)

4. **Rename and move the file**
   - Find the downloaded file (usually in Downloads folder)
   - It's named something like `client_secret_123456.json`
   - **Rename it to:** `client_secret.json` (exactly this name)
   - **Move it to:** `Google Docs Publisher/client_secret.json`

   üí° **Can't find the folder?** In Obsidian, right-click your vault name ‚Üí "Show in system explorer/Finder"

#### Step 3: First Authentication

**Let Claude Code handle this step!**

1. **In Claude Code, send this message:**
   ```
   Please authenticate the Google Docs Publisher.
   Run: node index.js TEST-MINIMAL.md
   ```

2. **Claude will give you a URL** - click it to open in your browser

3. **Authorize the app:**
   - Choose your Google account
   - If you see **"Google hasn't verified this app"**:
     - This is normal! It's YOUR app, so it's safe.
     - Click **"Advanced"**
     - Click **"Go to Obsidian Publisher (unsafe)"** ‚Üê (it's safe, Google just hasn't reviewed your personal app)
   - Click **"Allow"** to grant permissions

4. **Copy the authorization code** from the browser and paste it back to Claude Code

5. ‚úÖ **Done!** A file called `token.json` is created. You're authenticated forever (or until you delete this file).

   ```
   What's the full path to publish-active.sh that I should use in Obsidian Shell Commands?
   ```

   "/Users/YourName/.../Google Docs Publisher/publish-active.sh"

üéâ **You're done!** From now on, just press your hotkey to publish any note to Google Docs.

## üéØ What Works Right Now

When you publish a note, these markdown elements will be beautifully formatted in Google Docs:

**‚úÖ Fully Working:**
- **Headings** (H1-H6) - Styled with Pachyderm Global brand colors (Rubik font, custom blues)
- **Text formatting** - **Bold**, *italic*, ~~strikethrough~~, `inline code`
- **Links** - Become clickable blue links in Google Docs
- **Lists** - Both bulleted and numbered lists
- **Code blocks** - Monospace font with gray background
- **Blockquotes** - Indented and italicized
- **Horizontal rules** - Convert to lines
- **Tables** - Rendered as formatted text with borders

**‚ùå Not Supported:**
- Images (shows placeholder text: `[Image: filename]`)
- Footnotes
- Task lists (converts to regular bullets)
- Mermaid diagrams

**üìä About Tables:**
Tables render as formatted text (similar to markdown) rather than native Google Docs tables. This keeps them readable and reliable while we work on native table support for a future version.

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "I can't find where to move client_secret.json"
üí° **Ask Claude Code:** "Where should I put the client_secret.json file?" and Claude will tell you the exact path.

Or in Obsidian: Right-click your vault name in the left sidebar ‚Üí "Show in system explorer" (Windows) or "Reveal in Finder" (Mac), then navigate to the `Google Docs Publisher` folder.

### "Google hasn't verified this app"
This is normal! You're using your own personal app. Click **"Advanced"** ‚Üí **"Go to Obsidian Publisher (unsafe)"** - it's completely safe because YOU created it.

### "Hotkey doesn't work"
- First, try using the Command Palette instead: Press `Cmd+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+P` (Windows), then type "Publish to Google Docs"
- If that works, check your hotkey in Settings ‚Üí Hotkeys
- If nothing works, ask Claude Code: "Help me debug the Shell Commands setup"

### "Wrong file gets published"
The tool publishes whichever file you edited most recently. To ensure the right file publishes:
1. Click into the file you want to publish
2. Make any tiny edit (add a space, delete it)
3. Save (`Cmd+S` or `Ctrl+S`)
4. Now press your hotkey - it will publish that file

### "Command not found: node"
üí° **Ask Claude Code:** "Please help me fix the node command path in publish-active.sh"
