üí° **Not technical?** No problem! The guides are written for everyone, and Claude Code can help with any terminal steps.

## What Gets Formatted

**‚úÖ Fully Working:**
- **Headings (H1-H6)** - Styled with your brand colors and fonts (Rubik for headings, Source Sans 3 for body)
- **Text formatting** - **Bold**, *italic*, ~~strikethrough~~, `inline code`
- **Links** - Become clickable blue links in Google Docs
- **Lists** - Both bulleted and numbered, properly indented
- **Code blocks** - Monospace font with gray background
- **Blockquotes** - Indented and italicized
- **Horizontal rules** - Convert to visual separators
- **Tables** - Rendered as formatted text with borders (preserves structure and content)
- **Auto-clipboard** - URL copied automatically on Mac

**‚ùå Not Supported:**
- Images (shows placeholder: `[Image: filename]`)
- Footnotes
- Task lists (converts to regular bullets)
- Mermaid diagrams

**‚ÑπÔ∏è Note on Tables:**
Tables are rendered as formatted text (like code blocks) rather than native Google Docs tables. This approach is more reliable and still presents the data clearly. Native table support may come in a future version.

## Usage

### From Obsidian (Recommended)
1. Open any markdown note
2. Press your hotkey (e.g., `Alt+Shift+P`)
3. Wait 2-5 seconds
4. Get a popup with the Google Docs URL (auto-copied to clipboard on Mac)
5. Share the link with your team!

### From Command Line (For Specific Files)
Ask Claude Code:
```
Please publish this file to Google Docs: path/to/my-note.md
```

Or run manually:
```bash
cd "Google Docs Publisher"
node index.js "path/to/file.md"
```

## Customizing Your Brand

**Want different colors or fonts?** Edit `brandConfig.js`:

```javascript
H1: {
  fontFamily: 'Rubik',          // Any Google Font
  color: '#044A74',             // Your brand color (hex)
  fontSizePt: 20,               // Size in points
  bold: true,
  lineSpacing: 1.10,            // 110% spacing
  beforeSpacingPt: 12,          // Space before heading
  afterSpacingPt: 6             // Space after heading
}
```

**You can customize:**
- Colors for all heading levels and body text
- Font families (any Google Font works!)
- Font sizes
- Line spacing
- Paragraph spacing
- Bold/italic defaults

**Pro tip:** Ask Claude Code to help! "Please update brandConfig.js to use my brand colors: primary #FF5733, secondary #33C3FF"

## How It Works

1. **You press the hotkey** in Obsidian
2. **Script finds your file** - Identifies the most recently edited markdown file
3. **Parses markdown** - Converts to structured data the Google Docs API understands
4. **Authenticates** - Uses your stored OAuth token
5. **Creates doc** - Builds a new Google Doc with your brand styling applied
6. **Returns URL** - Shows you the link instantly

**No cloud storage involved!** Everything runs locally on your computer. Your files go directly from your machine to Google Docs.
