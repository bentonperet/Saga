# Test Document

This is a test document to verify the Google Docs publisher.

## Features to Test

### Text Formatting

This paragraph contains **bold text**, *italic text*, and `inline code`. You can also have [links to websites](https://example.com).

### Lists

Bulleted list:
- First item
- Second item with **bold**
- Third item with a [link](https://google.com)

Numbered list:
1. First step
2. Second step with *emphasis*
3. Third step

### Code Blocks

```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello from Google Docs!");
  return true;
}
```

### Horizontal Rule

## Conclusion

If all the above renders correctly in Google Docs with proper formatting, the publisher is working!
