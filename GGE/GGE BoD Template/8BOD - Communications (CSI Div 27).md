## OVERVIEW

Telecommunications infrastructure provides carrier-neutral, diverse, and redundant connectivity supporting 12 MW IT capacity with multiple fiber paths, cloud on-ramps, and structured cabling systems.

**Design Philosophy:**
- **Carrier-neutral:** Open access to all telecommunications carriers
- **Physical diversity:** Multiple fiber entry points from different directions
- **Scalability:** Infrastructure sized for 12 MW (expandable to 24 MW master plan)
- **Cloud connectivity:** Direct connections to AWS, Azure, GCP

## FIBER ENTRY & PATH DIVERSITY

### Dual Fiber Entry Points

**Primary Entry (East Side):**
- Location: East wall, near electrical yard
- Conduits: 4 × 4" PVC/HDPE from property line to MPOE-1
- Vault: Telecommunications manhole at property line (carrier hand-off point)
- Purpose: Primary carrier route

**Secondary Entry (West Side - Diversity):**
- Location: West wall, opposite side of building
- Conduits: 4 × 4" PVC/HDPE from property line to MPOE-2
- Vault: Separate telecommunications manhole
- Physical separation: >150 ft from primary entry
- Purpose: Geographic diversity (different carrier routes)

**Benefits of Dual Entry:**
- Redundancy: If one fiber route is cut, secondary route maintains connectivity
- Carrier diversity: Different carriers can use different entry points
- Future capacity: 8 total conduits support expansion to 24 MW

### Conduit Infrastructure

**Specifications:**
- **Material:** Schedule 40 PVC or HDPE
- **Size:** 4" inner diameter (accommodates multiple fiber cables)
- **Pull rope:** Installed in all conduits for future cable installation
- **Markers:** Conduit route markers every 50 ft (locatable)
- **Depth:** 36-48" burial depth per NEC Article 800

**Entry Seal:**
- Fire-rated conduit sealing compound at building penetrations
- Prevents water intrusion, fire spread, and pest entry

## MAIN POINT OF ENTRY (MPOE) & MEET-ME-ROOMS (MMR)

### Configuration

**2 × MPOE/MMR Facilities (Geographically Diverse):**

**MPOE-1 (Primary):**

**2. Facility Network (BMS/DCIM):**
- Building management system (HVAC, lighting)
- EPMS (electrical power monitoring)
- DCIM (rack power/cooling monitoring)
- Access control, CCTV

**3. Management Network (NOC/Admin):**
- NOC workstations
- Remote access (VPN gateway)
- Administrative access to facility systems

**Firewall:** Between IT and Facility networks (strict access control rules)

### Backbone Topology

## CLOUD CONNECTIVITY

### Cloud On-Ramp Strategy

**Direct connections to major cloud providers:**

**AWS Direct Connect:**
- Via carrier partners (Equinix, Megaport, etc.)
- Bandwidth: 1 Gbps, 10 Gbps, or 100 Gbps
- Latency: <5 ms to nearest AWS region (likely Dallas or Kansas City)

**Microsoft Azure ExpressRoute:**
- Via carrier partners
- Bandwidth: 50 Mbps to 100 Gbps
- Private connection to Azure services

**Google Cloud Platform (GCP):**
- **Proximity advantage:** Tbilisi is ~20 miles from Google's Mayes County data center campus
- **Potential for low-latency interconnect:** <2 ms if direct fiber route available
- **Interconnection options:**
  - Partner Interconnect (via carrier in MMR)
  - Dedicated Interconnect (if direct fiber to Google facility negotiated)

### Implementation

**Carrier Partners:**
- Carriers present in MMR offer cloud on-ramps as a service
- Customer orders cross-connect from MMR to their cabinet
- Carrier provides cloud connectivity (AWS, Azure, GCP)

**Customer Value:**
- Low-latency hybrid cloud deployments
- Reduced data egress costs (bypass internet)
- Secure private connectivity to cloud services

- Facility approves based on MMR capacity

**Step 2: Carrier Installation**
- Carrier pulls fiber from property line vault to assigned MMR
- Carrier installs equipment in assigned rack space
- Carrier terminates fiber on designated cross-connect panel

**Step 3: Cross-Connect Activation**
- Customer orders cross-connect from carrier panel to customer cabinet
- Facility staff install fiber patch cord (MMR → customer cabinet)
- Circuit tested and activated

**Step 4: Ongoing Maintenance**
- Carrier responsible for their equipment maintenance
- Facility provides rack space, power, cooling, security
