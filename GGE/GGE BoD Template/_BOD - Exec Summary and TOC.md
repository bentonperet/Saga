## KEY DESIGN DECISIONS

### **Why Tilt-Up Concrete (Not PEMB)**
- **Tornado resistance:** Pre-cast concrete withstands EF3-EF5 events better than steel framing
- **Insurance:** 30-40% lower premiums vs. PEMB in Tornado Alley
- **Thermal mass:** Better temperature stability, reduces HVAC cycling
- **Cost:** ~$15-25/SF premium over PEMB, justified by insurance savings and resilience

### **Utility Voltage Options**
- **13.8 kV or 12.47 kV:** Direct connection to 13.8 kV generators and MV distribution (no step-down required)
- **34.5 kV:** Requires two 34.5kV/13.8kV step-down transformers (~20 MVA each, N-1 redundancy)
  - Cost adder: ~$1.0-1.5M
  - Benefits: Often lower utility rates, better stability on high-voltage transmission

### **Why 13.8 kV Generators (Not 480V)**
- Standard product availability (3-5 MW range)
- Cable sizing: 13.8 kV reduces current by 29×
  - 4 MW @ 480V = 8,333 A (requires 6 × 500 kcmil/phase)
  - 4 MW @ 13.8 kV = 290 A (requires 1 × 2/0/phase)
- Easier paralleling and lower I²R losses

### **Why Separate Loop 3 (D2C Cooling)**
- **Air cooling (Loops 1+2):** Predictable, stable loads (±10% variation)
- **D2C cooling (Loop 3):** Violent load swings (0-100% in seconds)
- **Problems if mixed:** Control hunting, reduced efficiency, accelerated wear
- **Benefits of separation:** Optimized controls, clear contractor boundaries, independent maintenance, fault isolation

### **Why N+1 IT UPS with MV Dual-Ring (Not Traditional 2N UPS)**
- **Path redundancy** provided by 13.8 kV self-healing dual-ring MV distribution
- **Component redundancy** provided by N+1 modular UPS architecture
- IT equipment retains dual PDUs fed from different 480V panels (SWBD-A/B on different MV ring segments)
- **Advantages:** Lower capital cost (~40-50% fewer UPS modules), higher efficiency, simplified maintenance
- **Equivalent reliability:** MV dual-ring switching provides path diversity; N+1 UPS provides component failure tolerance

### **Why Slab-on-Grade (No Raised Floor)**
- Cost savings (~$150K+)
- Eliminates failure modes and underfloor plenum complications
- Better seismic performance
- Overhead cable distribution provides equivalent flexibility
