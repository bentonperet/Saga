# KEY CHANGES FROM 11kV TO 10kV
changes_from_11kv:
  voltage_changes:
    - "HPP step-up transformer: 400V / 10kV (was 400V / 11kV)"
    - "MV switchboards: 10kV rated (was 11kV)"
    - "Step-down transformers: 10kV / 400V (was 11kV / 400V)"
    - "Office transformer: 10kV / 400V (was 11kV / 400V)"
    - "Utility Grid incoming: 10kV (was 11kV)"

  equipment_impact:
    - "Transformer insulation class may change (10kV standard vs 11kV)"
    - "VCB ratings adjusted for 10kV system"
    - "Cable sizing may be slightly larger (same power, lower voltage = higher current)"

  no_changes:
    - "LV distribution remains 400V throughout"
    - "All 400V equipment unchanged"
    - "MTU Kinetic PowerPack output: 400V"
    - "Control and protection philosophy: same"
    - "MTM topology: unchanged"

  advantages_10kv:
    - "More standard voltage in some European/Asian markets"
    - "Potentially better equipment availability"
    - "Transformer and switchgear cost may be lower (more common voltage class)"
