  - **Dry Gulch Substation (N):** 161 kV service, 2 lines
- **Note:** Final voltage selection (345 kV vs 161 kV) depends on utility interconnection study, available capacity, and comparative economics. May change to 161 kV service with 161kV/13.8kV transformers if substation cost savings justify it.
- **Capacity:** 25-30 MVA (sized for 24 MW master plan + solar/BESS)
- **Metering:** Revenue-grade metering at transmission voltage (utility-owned)
- **Protection:** Distance relay, differential, overcurrent per utility standards

**345kV/13.8kV Substation Transformers:**
- **Quantity:** 2 transformers (N+1 redundancy - either can carry full load)
- **Rating:** 25 MVA each @ 345kV/13.8kV
- **Type:** Oil-filled, ONAN cooling
- **Configuration:** Delta-wye with neutral solidly grounded
- **Impedance:** ~8-10%
- **Location:** Outdoor substation yard on data center site

**Cost:** ~$7-12M for complete customer-owned substation (345 kV requires larger equipment and clearances than lower voltages)

**Benefits:**
- **Single 13.8 kV infrastructure** for utility, solar, BESS, generators, data center
- **US data center standard voltage** - better equipment availability and contractor familiarity
- **Microgrid capability** - island at 13.8 kV during utility outages

### Why 13.8 kV Generators (Not 480V)

**Technical Advantages:**
- **Cable sizing:** 13.8 kV reduces current by 29× vs. 480V
  - 4 MW @ 480V = 8,333 A → requires 6 × 500 kcmil per phase
  - 4 MW @ 13.8 kV = 290 A → requires 1 × 1/0 per phase (even smaller than 11 kV!)
- **I²R losses:** Lower current = dramatically reduced cable losses
- **Paralleling:** Easier to parallel MV generators than massive LV generators
- **US standard voltage:** 13.8 kV is the dominant voltage for US data center generators (better availability, shorter lead times)
- **Common voltage:** Matches utility substation, solar inverters, BESS inverters (13.8 kV is standard US renewable voltage)

### Generator Yard Layout

- **Location:** Outdoor electrical equipment yard (south side)
- **Arrangement:** Horizontal layout with 8-10 ft clearances
- **Fuel:** ~2,000 gal belly tanks per generator connected via common fuel manifold to centralized bulk fuel storage tank farm (24 hours runtime) with redundant supply contracts

### Phase 1: 5-6 × 1,250 kVA IT UPS Modules

**Modular Configuration:**
- 5-6 × 1,250 kVA / 1,000 kW modules in parallel
- 4-5 modules running, 1 standby (N+1)
- Running capacity: 4,000-5,000 kW for 3,000 kW IT load ✓
- Feeds: Multiple IT distribution panels fed from different 480V switchboards

**Path Redundancy:**

- **Automated switching:** SCADA-controlled ring switching provides path redundancy
- **Cabinet dual PDUs:** Fed from different 480V distribution panels (connected to SWBD-A and SWBD-B)

**Component Redundancy:**
- **N+1 UPS:** One UPS module fails → remaining N modules continue
- **Modular hot-swap:** Individual module replacement without downtime

**Battery:** 5-minute runtime maximum (allows for MV generator sync to bus, even two attempts) (Lithium-ion preferred)

### Phase 2: 13-15 × 1,250 kVA IT UPS Modules (add 8-9)

### Redundancy Philosophy

**Two Layers of Redundancy:**
1. **Path redundancy:** 13.8 kV dual-ring with self-healing automated switching (feeds SWBD-A and SWBD-B from different ring segments)
2. **Component redundancy:** N+1 UPS modular architecture (any single UPS module failure tolerated)

**Cabinet Dual PDUs:**
- Each cabinet has two PDUs fed from different 480V distribution panels
- Distribution panels connected to different switchboards (SWBD-A vs SWBD-B)
- SWBD-A and SWBD-B fed from different 13.8 kV ring segments
- Result: Full path diversity from 13.8 kV through cabinet PDU

**Advantages over Traditional 2N UPS:**
- **Lower capital cost:** ~40-50% fewer/smaller UPS modules
- **Higher efficiency:** Single UPS path = one fewer conversion stage
- **Simplified maintenance:** Fewer UPS systems to maintain
- **Equivalent reliability:** MV dual-ring provides path redundancy; N+1 UPS provides component redundancy

## NON-CRITICAL BUILDING POWER (HOUSE POWER)

### Philosophy

**Separate from Critical Systems:** Non-critical building services operate on independent electrical infrastructure from data hall and MMR critical systems.

**Purpose:** Avoid impact to critical infrastructure from non-critical loads; enable independent maintenance and testing.

### Non-Critical Areas Served

- **Office spaces** (conference rooms, hoteling offices, call pods, seating areas)
- **Bathrooms** (restrooms, showers)
- **Hallways and corridors**
- **Security Control Room (SCR)** - main entrance
- **Security Control Booth (SCB)** - loading dock
- **Loading dock** (lighting, doors, HVAC)
- **Staging and storage areas**
- **Break room, lounge, gaming area**
- **NOC** (Network Operations Center) - non-IT systems
- **Gym/fitness center**
- **Storm shelter/safe room** (lighting, ventilation)
- **Building HVAC** (office RTUs, exhaust fans)
- **General lighting** (non-emergency)
- **Elevator** (non-critical use)

### Utility Service

**Primary Power:**
- **Source:** Single 13.8kV/480V transformer fed from Solar/BESS system (via 13.8 kV common bus)
- **Voltage:** 480V, 3-phase, 4-wire
- **Capacity:** ~400 kVA (300-350 kW sustained load)
- **Single Point of Failure:** Acceptable (redundant natural gas house generators provide backup)
- **No PDMs Required:** House power uses standard distribution, not prefabricated modules

### Backup Power - Natural Gas House Generators

**Configuration:** Redundant natural gas generators provide backup power to non-critical areas during utility failure

**Specifications:**
- **Quantity:** 2 generators (N+1 redundancy)
- **Rating:** 250-350 kW each @ 480V, 3-phase, 60 Hz
- **Fuel:** Natural gas (piped from utility or on-site propane if NG not available)
- **Fuel supply:** Utility natural gas service with redundant supply contract
- **Endurance:** Unlimited runtime (continuous fuel supply)
- **Automatic Transfer Switch (ATS):** Two ATSs (one per generator) with priority load shedding
- **Start time:** <10 seconds to rated voltage
- **Paralleling:** Capable of paralleling for load sharing
- **Enclosure:** Sound-attenuated outdoor enclosure
- **Emissions:** EPA-compliant natural gas emissions

**Rationale for Natural Gas:**
- **Unlimited runtime:** No fuel storage/delivery logistics
- **Lower maintenance:** Cleaner burning than diesel
- **Cost-effective:** Lower fuel and maintenance costs for house power
- **Independent from critical diesel supply:** Preserves diesel fuel for critical IT loads
- **Compliance:** Meets emission standards for continuous backup power

### Portable UPS for IT Systems in Non-Critical Areas

**Purpose:** Provide ride-through battery power for IT equipment in non-critical spaces during transfer to house generators (~10-15 seconds)

**Applications:**
- **NOC workstations** and display systems
- **SCR/SCB security workstations** and surveillance equipment
- **Office IT equipment** (workstations, network switches, VoIP phones)
- **BMS/DCIM servers** (if not on critical UPS)

**Configuration:**
- **Type:** Portable rack-mount or tower UPS units
- **Capacity:** Sized per load (typical: 1-3 kVA per workstation/equipment cluster)
- **Runtime:** 10-15 minutes (sufficient for natural gas house generator startup <10 sec + graceful shutdown if needed)
- **Topology:** Line-interactive or online double-conversion
- **Quantity:** ~20-30 units distributed throughout facility

**Cost:** ~$50-100K for house generators + ATS; ~$30-50K for portable UPS units
