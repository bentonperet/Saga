## KEY DESIGN DECISIONS

### Why Precast Tilt-Up (Not PEMB)?
- **Tornado risk:** Georgia is EF3-EF5 zone; precast provides superior impact/wind resistance
- **Insurance:** FM Global/insurance carriers require hardened construction in tornado regions
- **Long-term:** 50+ year lifespan, minimal maintenance vs. PEMB corrosion/repair

### Why FM 1-150 Roof?
- **Wind:** 150 mph 3-second gust exceeds most tornado wind speeds below EF3
- **Insurance:** Premium reduction offsets cost in 5-7 years
- **Customer confidence:** Tier III uptime requires robust envelope

### Why FEMA 361 Storm Shelter/Safe Room?
- **Life safety:** Georgia tornado fatalities; shelter protects staff/visitors during extreme events
- **Code:** May become required by local AHJ in tornado-prone areas
- **Insurance:** Demonstrates commitment to risk mitigation
