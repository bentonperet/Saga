### Control Strategies

**Free Cooling Optimization:**

- Target: 3,500-4,000 hrs/year free cooling in Tbilisi, Georgia

**Chiller Sequencing:**
- Target 67% utilization per chiller for optimal efficiency
- Rotate chillers weekly to equalize runtime
- Stage chillers based on load (prevent short cycling)

**Pump VFD Control:**
- Modulate pump speed to maintain differential pressure setpoint
- ΔP setpoint: 15-20 psi at most remote cabinet/CDU
- Reduce pumping energy during part-load conditions

**Supply Water Temperature Reset:**
- Phase 1 (air cooling): 7-10°C supply, reset up during low load
- Phase 2 (Loop 3 D2C): 25°C supply, fixed (optimal for GPUs)

**White Space Environmental Control:**
- Maintain 18-27°C, 40-60% RH per ASHRAE A1
- DOAS modulates outdoor air dampers to maintain +0.02-0.05 in. w.g. pressure
- Humidification/dehumidification staged based on RH sensors

### Alarms & Notifications

**Critical Alarms (Immediate Response):**

- Low glycol level (makeup required)
- **Notification:** BMS dashboard + email

**Escalation:**
- If no acknowledgment within 15 minutes → escalate to backup on-call engineer
- If no acknowledgment within 30 minutes → escalate to manager

## MICROGRID CONTROLLER (345kV/13.8kV SYSTEM)

### Purpose

Coordinates utility, solar, BESS, and generators on common 13.8kV bus infrastructure. Manages islanding (utility outage), load shedding, and seamless transitions between grid-connected and island modes.

### System Configuration

**Power Sources on 13.8kV Bus:**
- 345kV utility (2 × 25 MVA transformers, 2N)
- Solar array (8+ MW AC via 13.8kV inverters)
- BESS (4-8 MWh via 13.8kV bi-directional inverters)
- Generators (6 × 4.0 MW @ 13.8kV)

**Loads on 13.8kV Bus:**
- Data center (8 × 13.8kV/480V transformers → IT + mechanical loads)
- Auxiliary loads (minimal)

### Control Modes

**Mode 1: Grid-Connected (Normal Operation)**
- Utility + Solar → Data Center Load
- BESS: Charge from solar (if excess), discharge for peak shaving/demand response
- Generators: Standby (periodic testing only)
- Export: If permitted, sell excess solar to grid

**Mode 2: Island Mode (Utility Outage)**
- Disconnect from utility at 345kV (automatic transfer switch or breaker)
- Generators + Solar + BESS → Data Center Load
- Generator black start (if needed) or BESS provides voltage reference
- Solar output curtailed if load < generation (no export in island mode)
- Duration: Unlimited (diesel fuel + solar during daylight)

**Mode 3: Transition Back to Grid (Utility Restored)**
- Synchronize 13.8kV bus with utility (match voltage, frequency, phase)
- Close utility breaker (seamless transfer)
- Unload generators (ramp down over 5-10 minutes)
- Resume normal grid-connected operation

### Microgrid Controller Specifications

**Standards Compliance:**
- **IEEE 2030.7:** Microgrid Controller Standard
- **IEEE 2030.8:** Testing Standard for Microgrid Controllers

- **Load shedding:** Drop non-critical loads if generation < load in island mode
- **Generator dispatch:** Start/stop generators based on load/solar availability
- **BESS control:** Charge/discharge commands based on grid status, solar output, load
- **Solar curtailment:** Reduce solar output if overgeneration in island mode
- **Synchronization:** Re-sync with utility when restored

**Recommended Vendors:**
- GE Grid Solutions (Reason M60 or equivalent)

- ABB Ability OPTIMAX
- Siemens SICAM (if SCADA-based microgrid control sufficient)

**Cost:** [ROM] $1.0-1.5M (IEEE 2030.7/2030.8 compliant controller + engineering)

### Benefits of Customer-Owned 345kV Substation + Microgrid

**Resiliency:**

- Solar + BESS + generators operate indefinitely without utility

**Flexibility:**
- Export excess solar to grid (if permitted by utility)
- Demand response participation (discharge BESS during grid peak events)
- Future load growth (24 MW master plan) without utility upgrades

**Cost Savings:**
- Avoid utility demand charges via peak shaving (BESS discharge during peaks)
- Avoid utility interconnection fees for each new load addition
- Single 13.8kV infrastructure for all power sources and loads
