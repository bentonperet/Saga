## OVERVIEW

Plumbing systems provide domestic water service, fire protection water supply, sanitary/storm drainage, and chilled water makeup for closed-loop glycol systems. Zero water consumption for cooling operations (air-cooled chillers eliminate evaporative losses).

**Design Philosophy:**
- **Zero cooling water:** Air-cooled chillers, closed-loop glycol (WUE <0.5 L/kWh)
- **Minimal domestic use:** Staff amenities only (~10-20 occupants)
- **Leak detection:** Comprehensive system protecting IT equipment
- **Sustainable design:** Stormwater management, low-flow fixtures
