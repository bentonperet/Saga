**Capacity:** 8+ MW DC solar array

**Footprint Estimate:**
- Rule of thumb: 5-7 acres (2.0-2.8 ha) per MW DC for ground-mount solar

## DESIGN NOTES

### Space Efficiency

**Current Allocation vs. Design Requirement:**
- **Current BOD allocation:** ~150,000 SF (13,935 m²) (electrical + mechanical yards)
- **Calculated requirement:** ~135,000 SF (12,542 m²) (electrical + mechanical, excluding substation)
- **Margin:** +11% buffer

**Including Substation:**
- **Current BOD allocation:** Not explicitly separated
- **Calculated requirement:** ~177,500 SF (16,491 m²) (electrical + mechanical + substation)
- **Recommended total allocation:** **~200,000 SF (18,581 m²)** (includes 13% expansion margin)

### Critical Clearances

**NESC/NEC Requirements:**
- **345 kV equipment:** 25 ft (7.6 m) minimum approach distance
- **13.8 kV equipment:** 10 ft (3.0 m) minimum working clearance
- **480V equipment:** 3-6 ft (0.9-1.8 m) working clearance (per NEC)

**Fire Code (IFC/NFPA):**
- **Fire lanes:** 20 ft (6.1 m) minimum width, 26 ft (7.9 m) overhead clearance
- **Hydrant spacing:** 500 ft (152 m) maximum
- **Generator separation:** 3 ft (0.9 m) minimum between units (or rated enclosure clearance)

**Crane Access:**
- **Mobile crane setup:** 50 ft × 50 ft (15.2 m × 15.2 m) minimum for large equipment
- **Generator removal:** 30 ft (9.1 m) access aisle minimum

### Layout Optimization Strategies

**Electrical & Mechanical Yard Integration:**
- Position mechanical yard south of building (prevailing wind consideration for chiller noise)
- Position electrical yard north/east of building (separates noise sources)
- Centralize bulk fuel storage at electrical yard perimeter (tanker truck access from perimeter road)

**345 kV Substation Placement:**
- Northwest corner of site (utility transmission line approach from north/west typical)
- Separate fenced enclosure (security + electrical safety)
- Direct 13.8 kV ductbank route to electrical yard

**Future Expansion:**
- Reserve space for 2 additional generators (Phase 3: 30 MW)
- Reserve space for 4 additional chillers (Phase 3: 18 MW)
- Modular layout allows incremental build-out

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Allocate 200,000 SF (18,581 m²) total for secured equipment yards** (electrical + mechanical + substation)
   - Electrical yard: 100,000 SF (9,290 m²) (includes substation, fuel, expansion margin)
   - Mechanical yard: 50,000 SF (4,645 m²) (adequate for 12 chillers + expansion to 16)
   - Perimeter buffer/roads: 50,000 SF (4,645 m²)

2. **Separate BESS yard** (if deployed): Allocate 15,000 SF (1,394 m²) adjacent to electrical yard

3. **Solar array** (if co-located): Reserve 50-60 acres (20.2-24.3 ha) on separate parcel or designated zone

4. **Fire access:** Ensure continuous 20 ft (6.1 m) fire lane around all equipment yards with hydrants at 500 ft (152 m) spacing

5. **Security:** Single perimeter fence encompassing all equipment yards (reduces redundant fencing cost)

6. **Phased Build:** Phase 1 can occupy ~50% of allocated space; reserve remaining for Phase 2/3 expansion
