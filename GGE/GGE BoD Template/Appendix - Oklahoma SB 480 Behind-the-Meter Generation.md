## 1. PURPOSE

Oklahoma SB 480 redefines Oklahoma's energy framework to allow private entities to generate and consume their own power — particularly for large industrial, manufacturing, and data center operations — without being regulated as public utilities under the Oklahoma Corporation Commission.

**Key Objectives:**
- Enable self-generation and behind-the-meter power systems
- Support economic growth and investment attraction
- Enhance grid stability through distributed generation
- Leverage Oklahoma's natural gas resources

---

## 2. PRIMARY REQUIREMENTS

### Natural Gas Component Mandate

**Critical Requirement:**
- All exempt private generation systems **must include a natural gas component** in their power generation mix
- Purely renewable or battery systems without a natural gas element **do not qualify** under SB 480
- Natural gas turbines, microturbines, or combined-heat-and-power (CHP) systems required

**Compliant Technology Examples:**
- Gas turbine + solar hybrid systems
- Natural gas microturbines + battery energy storage systems (BESS)

- Reciprocating gas engines with solar/wind

**Non-Compliant Examples:**
- 100% solar + BESS systems (no gas component)
- Pure renewable microgrids without gas generation
- Diesel-only generation systems

### Exemption from Public Utility Classification

**Exemption Criteria:**
- Entities generating electricity solely for **their own use** or for a **specific contracted customer** are not considered public utilities
- Exempt producers may operate outside Oklahoma Corporation Commission regulation on retail energy service
- Private power-purchase agreements (PPAs) or energy-as-a-service models permitted between private parties

**Permitted Use Cases:**
1. Self-generation on owned or leased property for exclusive use
2. Power-purchase agreements (PPAs) between private parties (non-public)
3. Energy-as-a-service models for specific contracted customers

### Prohibited Activities

**Cannot:**
- Sell electricity to the general public
- Serve multiple unaffiliated customers without risk of reclassification
- Act as a retail electricity provider

**Risk:**
- Any attempt to serve multiple unaffiliated customers may reclassify the producer as a regulated utility subject to Oklahoma Corporation Commission oversight

## 5. PRYOR DATA CENTER COMPLIANCE STRATEGY

### Current Design Status

**Existing Infrastructure:**
- 345 kV owner-constructed substation (2 × 25 MVA transformers, 345kV/13.8kV)
- 13.8 kV common bus architecture
- 6 × 4.0 MW diesel generators @ 13.8 kV (N+1 redundancy)
- 8+ MW solar array (adjacent, behind-the-meter)
- Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) integration planned

**SB 480 Compliance Gap:**
- ❌ Current design does not include natural gas component
- ❌ Diesel generators do not satisfy SB 480 natural gas requirement
- ❌ Solar + BESS alone insufficient for SB 480 exemption

### Recommended Compliance Approach

**Option 1: Add Natural Gas Turbine Generators**

**Configuration:**
- Add 2-4 × natural gas turbine generators @ 13.8 kV
- Capacity: 3-5 MW each (similar to existing diesel generators)
- Integration: Parallel with 13.8 kV common bus
- Fuel: Natural gas via pipeline connection

**Advantages:**
- Qualifies for SB 480 exemption
- Diversifies fuel supply (natural gas + diesel backup)
- Potential for lower fuel costs vs. diesel (depending on gas prices)
- Cleaner emissions than diesel (lower NOx, particulates)
- Enables combined-cycle or CHP opportunities (waste heat recovery)

**Cost Estimate:**
- Natural gas turbine generators: $1.5-3.0M per MW (installed)
- Natural gas infrastructure (pipeline tap, gas metering, compression if required): $500K-2M
- Fuel gas treatment system (if required): $200K-500K
- Total incremental cost: $5-15M (depending on configuration and pipeline distance)

**Option 2: Retrofit Existing Diesel Generators for Dual-Fuel (Diesel + Natural Gas)**

**Configuration:**
- Retrofit 3-6 existing diesel generators for dual-fuel operation
- Primary fuel: Natural gas (pipeline)
- Backup fuel: Diesel (~2,000 gal belly tanks per generator + centralized bulk fuel storage)
- Mode: Natural gas primary with diesel pilot injection

**Advantages:**
- Lower capital cost than new gas turbines
- Leverages existing generator investment
- Maintains diesel backup capability
- Qualifies for SB 480 exemption (natural gas component present)

**Challenges:**
- Not all diesel generators can be economically retrofitted
- May require manufacturer support for dual-fuel kits
- Potential de-rating when operating on natural gas
- Emissions compliance more complex in dual-fuel mode

**Cost Estimate:**
- Dual-fuel retrofit kits: $200K-500K per generator
- Natural gas infrastructure: $500K-2M
- Total incremental cost: $1.5-5M (6 generators + infrastructure)

**Option 3: Add Small Natural Gas Microturbines for Base Load + Incentive Qualification**

**Configuration:**
- Add 3-5 × natural gas microturbines (500 kW - 1 MW each)
- Total capacity: 2-5 MW natural gas generation
- Operation: Base load or peak shaving mode
- Integration: 480V or 11 kV (via step-up transformers)

**Advantages:**
- Lower capital cost than large gas turbines
- CHP potential (waste heat recovery for building HVAC or process heat)
- Qualifies for SB 480 exemption (natural gas component)
- Continuous operation demonstrates gas component utilization
- High efficiency at partial load (vs. large turbines)

**Challenges:**
- Lower per-MW capacity vs. diesel generators (not full facility backup)
- Maintenance requirements (gas turbines require periodic overhauls)
- Noise and vibration considerations (outdoor installation typical)

**Cost Estimate:**
- Microturbines: $2-3M per MW (installed, including CHP if applicable)
- Natural gas infrastructure: $500K-2M
- Total incremental cost: $4-10M (3-5 MW microturbines + infrastructure)

### Natural Gas Infrastructure Requirements
