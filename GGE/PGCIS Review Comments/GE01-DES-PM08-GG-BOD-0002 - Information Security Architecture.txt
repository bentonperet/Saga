3.18 Change & Configuration Management
Principles
* All changes must be controlled, tested, and documented.
* Configurations must be maintained in an up-to-date, secure, and auditable state.
* System security should be evaluated before, during, and after changes.
* Changes must follow the principle of least disruption to services and business operations.
* Responsibilities for change approval, implementation, and verification must be clearly assigned.
* Unauthorized or ad-hoc changes are strictly prohibited.
* Audit trails of changes must be retained for compliance and incident investigation purposes.
Requirements
1. Establish a centralized change approval process (CAB ? Change Advisory Board).
2. Maintain version control and rollback capability.
3. Perform impact analysis (including security risk assessment) before changes.
4. Assign responsibilities for implementation, verification, and documentation.
5. Separate rights for initiating, approving, and executing changes (4-eyes principle).
6. Test changes in an isolated staging environment.
7. Inventory all configurations with versions, owners, and statuses.
8. Automate configuration compliance checks against security policies.
9. Periodically audit and analyze change management effectiveness.
Implementation
A. Use ITSM platforms (e.g., ServiceNow) for change registration and approval.
B. Maintain change logs with author, date, and description.
C. Configure automatic backup of configurations before each change.
D. Conduct impact analysis and test changes in a controlled environment before deployment.
E. Separate roles among developers, administrators, and auditors.
F. Centralize storage and version control of configuration files.
G. Periodically compare current configurations with baseline and automatically alert deviations.
H. Support rollback procedures if errors are detected.


















3.19 Data Privacy & Protection
Principles
* Personal and confidential data must be processed with principles of minimization, legality, and transparency.
* Access is granted strictly on a need-to-know basis (principle of least privilege).
* Data processing must be documented and controlled at all stages.
Requirements
1. Comply with ISO/IEC 27701 and local data protection laws (e.g., GDPR).
2. Control data transfer to third parties, including DPA/NDA agreements.
3. Ensure data subject rights: access, correction, deletion, portability.
4. Appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO) and define responsibilities.
5. Define retention periods and secure deletion of personal data.
6. Implement encryption and pseudonymization for storage and transmission.
7. Establish timely data breach notification procedures.
8. Train employees on privacy and personal data handling.
Implementation
A. Deploy DLP systems and data protection policies.
B. Conduct periodic audits of personal data processing and storage.
C. Perform DPIA (Data Protection Impact Assessments).
D. Appoint a DPO and document roles/responsibilities.
E. Encrypt personal data in storage, backups, and transmission.
F. Develop secure deletion and anonymization procedures.
G. Implement automated notifications for personal data incidents.
H. Conduct regular staff training on personal data handling and ISO/IEC 27701 compliance.
