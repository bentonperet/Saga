| **GGE-CAS-DES-BOD-C02**   | **CAPACITY MISMATCH**: Total IT capacity stated as 5.635 MW but Phase 1 shows only 2.385 MW and Phase 2 shows 3.250 MW, which totals 5.635 MW. However, HPP power source is only 3.7 MW, creating a 1.935 MW shortfall for full buildout.                                                                                           | **CRITICAL**     | The Mtkvari HPP can only provide 3.7 MW, but the facility IT load alone requires 5.635 MW. Even with PUE of 1.5, total facility load would be ~8.5 MW. This represents a fundamental power source undersizing that would prevent Phase 2 operation without significant utility grid reliance, contradicting the "100% renewable" claim.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 1) Increase HPP capacity to minimum 6 MW (IT) + 3 MW (infrastructure) = 9 MW total, OR 2) Revise capacity targets to match available HPP power (max 2.5 MW IT load for 3.7 MW HPP), OR 3) Explicitly design for grid power as primary with HPP as supplemental and revise sustainability claims                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Page 3, Section 1 "Energy source: 3.7 MW Mtkvari HPP" vs. Page 2 "Total IT capacity: 5.635 MW"                      |
| **GGE-CAS-DES-BOD-C02**   | **TRANSFORMER UNDERSIZING**: Each group has 1 × 3000 kVA transformer (2N = 2 transformers per group, 4 total). Group 1 IT load is 2,385 kW (requires ~3,580 kVA at 0.95 PF + infrastructure). Group 2 will be 3,250 kW (requires ~4,875 kVA). Single 3000 kVA transformer cannot support either group's full load.                  | **CRITICAL**     | For Tier III 2N, each transformer must carry full load independently. Group 1 needs minimum 3,600 kVA and Group 2 needs minimum 4,900 kVA transformers. Current 3000 kVA sizing would cause overload on single-side operation, violating concurrent maintainability and creating a single point of failure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Resize transformers: Group 1 minimum 2 × 4000 kVA (2N), Group 2 minimum 2 × 5000 kVA (2N). Verify 2N topology allows full IT + infrastructure load on single transformer with adequate margin (recommend 20-25% margin).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Page 6, Section 4 "Transformers: 4 total (2 per group) Each group includes 1 × 3000 kVA"                            |
| **GGE-CAS-DES-BOD-C02**   | **GENERATOR UNDERSIZING**: 4 × 2500 kVA generators total (2 per group) in 2N configuration. Group 1 requires ~3,600 kVA and Group 2 requires ~4,900 kVA. Single 2500 kVA generator cannot support full group load during maintenance or failure of one generator.                                                                   | **CRITICAL**     | Tier III requires N+1 or 2N generator configuration where loss of one generator does not impact IT load. With 2500 kVA units, single generator cannot carry full group load (needs 3,600 kVA for Group 1, 4,900 kVA for Group 2), violating Tier III concurrent maintainability requirement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Resize generators to match transformer capacity: Group 1 minimum 2 × 3000 kW (3750 kVA) generators, Group 2 minimum 2 × 4000 kW (5000 kVA) generators. Consider N+1 per group instead of 2N for better efficiency and flexibility.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Page 6, Section 4 "Generators: 4 × 2500 kVA total (2 per group)"                                                    |
| **GGE-CAS-DES-BOD-C02**   | **FUEL AUTONOMY CALCULATION ERROR**: States ≥72 h autonomy with 20 t (metric ton) fuel storage and 563.8 L/h consumption. Calculation: 20,000 L ÷ 563.8 L/h = 35.5 hours, NOT 72 hours. Assuming diesel density of 0.85 kg/L, 20 t = 23,529 L, which gives 41.7 hours. Still significantly less than claimed 72 hours.              | **CRITICAL**     | Fuel autonomy is a key Tier III requirement and critical operational parameter. Underestimating fuel consumption or overestimating autonomy could result in facility shutdown during extended utility outages. The stated 72-hour autonomy appears to be based on partial load, not full facility load with all generators running.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 1) Recalculate fuel consumption at full load for all 4 generators (likely 800-1000 L/h total). 2) For true 72h autonomy at full load, increase bulk fuel storage to minimum 60 t (70,000 L). 3) Clarify if 72h is at full load or partial load. 4) Consider additional day tank capacity (currently only 1 m³ each).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Page 6, Section "Fuel system" - "Fuel storage tank: 20 t, Fuel consumption: 563.8 L/h, ≥72 h autonomy"              |
| **GGE-CAS-DES-BOD-C02**   | **UPS BATTERY AUTONOMY SPECIFICATION UNCLEAR**: Battery autonomy stated as "≥10-15 min" but does not specify the load condition used for this calculation (full IT load, partial load, IT + infrastructure, etc.). Cannot verify if runtime is adequate without understanding the basis.                                            | **HIGH**         | UPS battery runtime specifications must clearly state the load condition. Modern generators typically start in 10-15 seconds, so 10-15 minutes may be adequate for Tier III if calculated at full load. However, without knowing the load basis, cannot verify: 1) If runtime includes both IT load (5.635 MW) and infrastructure loads, 2) If calculation accounts for battery aging and temperature derating, 3) If adequate margin exists for generator first-start failure + retry scenario.                                                            | Clarify UPS battery specification: 1) Confirm 10-15 min runtime is calculated at **full Phase 2 IT load (5.635 MW) plus infrastructure loads**, 2) Specify battery end-of-life capacity (typically 80% of nameplate), 3) Confirm calculation includes temperature derating for worst-case conditions, 4) If runtime is at partial load only, recalculate and specify runtime at full load. Provide battery sizing calculation for verification.                                                                                                          | Page 6, Section 4 "LiFePO₄ battery banks, ≥10-15 min autonomy"                                                      |
| **GGE-CAS-DES-BOD-C02**   | **MISSING CHILLER CAPACITY AND REDUNDANCY SPEC**: Document states "Chiller plant (N+1), dual segregated loops" but provides no chiller capacity, quantity, or sizing information. Cannot verify if cooling capacity matches IT load or if N+1 redundancy is properly implemented.                                                   | **HIGH**         | Cooling system is critical path for data center operation. Without chiller specifications, cannot verify: 1) Total cooling capacity matches IT load + infrastructure heat, 2) N+1 redundancy is adequate, 3) Free cooling integration is properly sized, 4) River water heat rejection capacity is sufficient. Missing specifications prevent validation of PUE ≤ 1.5 target.                                                                                                                                                                               | Add detailed chiller specifications including: 1) Chiller quantity and capacity (kW/ton), 2) N+1 redundancy configuration (e.g., 4 × 1500 kW chillers for 4500 kW load), 3) Free cooling operating range and capacity, 4) Integration with river water and ground thermal systems, 5) Redundant pumping and distribution design.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Page 7, Section 5 "Chiller plant (N+1), dual segregated loops"                                                      |
| **GGE-CAS-DES-BOD-C02**   | **SEISMIC DESIGN INCOMPLETE**: States "Seismicity: Zone VIII, PGA 0.25-0.27 g" but provides no seismic design criteria, equipment anchorage requirements, or inter-story drift limits. Zone VIII represents significant seismic hazard requiring robust design.                                                                     | **HIGH**         | Tbilisi is in a seismically active region. PGA 0.25-0.27g represents moderate-high seismic hazard. Without detailed seismic design criteria, risk of: 1) Equipment damage/failure during earthquake, 2) Piping system failure and flooding, 3) Electrical system damage, 4) Loss of concurrent maintainability due to earthquake damage. Seismic design is critical for facility resilience and Tier III certification in seismic zones.                                                                                                                    | Add comprehensive seismic design criteria section including: 1) IBC/Eurocode 8 seismic design parameters, 2) Equipment anchorage and bracing requirements (IBC Chapter 13/ASCE 7-16 Ch 13), 3) Flexible connections for piping systems, 4) Seismic separation joints, 5) Emergency shutdown procedures for seismic events, 6) Post-earthquake inspection protocols.                                                                                                                                                                                      | Page 4, Section 2 "Seismicity: Zone VIII, PGA 0.25-0.27 g"                                                          |
| **GGE-CAS-DES-BOD-C02**   | **RIVER WATER COOLING RISK NOT ADDRESSED**: Reliance on Kura River for free cooling with no discussion of: 1) River water quality and fouling potential, 2) Seasonal flow variations and minimum flow guarantees, 3) Drought contingency, 4) Regulatory/permitting risks, 5) Environmental impact of heat rejection.                | **HIGH**         | River water systems introduce significant operational and regulatory risks: 1) Water quality (silt, biological growth, chemical content) can foul heat exchangers and reduce efficiency, 2) Seasonal variations may reduce/eliminate cooling capacity during low flow periods, 3) Drought conditions could eliminate river cooling entirely, 4) Heat discharge permits may be difficult to obtain or may limit discharge temperature/quantity, 5) Equipment corrosion from elevated sulfates/chlorides mentioned in BoD.                                    | Develop comprehensive river water system risk assessment and mitigation plan including: 1) Water quality analysis and treatment requirements, 2) Heat exchanger selection for fouling resistance (plate vs shell-tube), 3) Backup cooling capacity if river water unavailable (minimum N+1 chillers sized for full mechanical cooling), 4) Regulatory/permitting pathway and contingencies, 5) Materials selection for corrosive water chemistry, 6) Monitoring and maintenance protocols.                                                               | Page 7, Section 5 "River-water free cooling & ground-thermal"                                                       |
| **GGE-CAS-DES-BOD-C02**   | **PHASING INCONSISTENCY**: Phase 1 document title states "Tier III+ Certification Scope" but document body states "Tier III Certified" and "Tier III Compliance" without the "+" designation. Unclear if target is Tier III or Tier III+ (which has additional requirements including fault tolerance).                             | **MEDIUM**       | Tier III and Tier III+ have different design requirements. Tier III requires concurrent maintainability (N+1, 2N with CM). Tier III+ requires fault tolerance (ability to sustain single worst-case failure without impact). If target is Tier III+, current design may be insufficient. If target is Tier III, title page is incorrect and creates confusion.                                                                                                                                                                                              | Clarify certification target: 1) If Tier III (CM), remove "+" from title and confirm 2N with CM meets requirements. 2) If Tier III+ (FT), add fault-tolerant design requirements including 2(N+1) or distributed redundant system (DRS), fault-tolerant cooling with dual independent chillers per load, and enhanced monitoring. Update design criteria throughout document to match target tier.                                                                                                                                                       | Page 1 title "Tier III+ Certification Scope" vs. Page 2 "Certification target: Uptime Institute Tier III Certified" |
| **GGE-CAS-DES-BOD-C02**   | **DIRECT-TO-CHIP LIQUID COOLING LACK OF DETAIL**: Quantum AI phase uses "direct-to-chip liquid cooling" for 2.5 MW at 25 kW/rack density but provides no specifications for CDU (Coolant Distribution Unit) quantity, capacity, redundancy, or integration with facility cooling plant.                                             | **MEDIUM**       | Direct liquid cooling at 25 kW/rack represents 50-60% of rack heat load and requires specialized equipment and design. Without specifications: 1) Cannot verify cooling capacity and redundancy, 2) Cannot assess facility cooling loop integration, 3) Cannot validate separate Loop 3 design for AI loads, 4) Risk of insufficient capacity or poor redundancy implementation.                                                                                                                                                                            | Add direct liquid cooling specifications including: 1) CDU quantity and capacity (likely 100 × 25 kW or 50 × 50 kW CDUs), 2) Redundancy model (N+1, 2N, or A/B per rack), 3) Coolant type and temperature range, 4) Integration with chiller Loop 3, 5) Leak detection and containment measures, 6) Secondary air cooling backup capacity.                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Page 3 "Quantum (AI): 2.5 MW, 100 racks, direct-to-chip liquid cooling" and Page 7 "direct-to-chip liquid for AI"   |
| **GGE-CAS-DES-BOD-C02**   | **FIRE SUPPRESSION SYSTEM MISMATCH**: States "Inergen/Novec in IT halls" but also mentions "pre-action water mist in plant areas." Mixing gaseous and water-based suppression in adjacent spaces creates complexity and potential conflicts, especially for electrical/battery rooms.                                               | **MEDIUM**       | Fire suppression system selection must consider: 1) Clean agent (Inergen/Novec) for IT spaces is appropriate, 2) Water mist in electrical rooms (UPS, battery, switchgear) is problematic due to electrical equipment damage risk, 3) Pre-action water sprinkler (not mist) may be more appropriate for mechanical plant, 4) Inergen/Novec should be considered for UPS/battery rooms due to LiFePO₄ battery fire risk and electrical equipment.                                                                                                            | Review and rationalize fire suppression strategy: 1) IT halls: Inergen/Novec (appropriate), 2) UPS/Battery rooms: Inergen/Novec or Novec 1230 (not water), 3) Mechanical/Chiller rooms: Pre-action sprinkler (appropriate), 4) Electrical switchgear rooms: Novec 1230 or high-expansion foam, 5) Ensure proper compartmentalization and suppression zone design. Coordinate with fire marshal and insurance underwriter.                                                                                                                                | Page 8, Section 6 "Suppression: Inergen/Novec in IT halls, pre-action water mist in plant areas"                    |
| **GGE-CAS-DES-BOD-C02**   | **PUE TARGET LACKS SUPPORTING CALCULATIONS**: Target annualized PUE ≤ 1.5 stated but no PUE calculation, energy model, or supporting analysis provided. Cannot verify if target is achievable with proposed systems (river free cooling, ground thermal, direct liquid cooling) and Tbilisi climate conditions.                     | **MEDIUM**       | PUE targets drive cooling system design and operational strategy. Without supporting calculations and assumptions, cannot verify: 1) River/ground cooling availability hours and effectiveness in Tbilisi climate, 2) Chiller plant efficiency at varying loads and ambient conditions, 3) Free cooling temperature thresholds and switching logic, 4) Electrical infrastructure losses (transformer, UPS, distribution), 5) Direct liquid cooling impact on overall facility PUE, 6) Whether 1.5 PUE target is realistic or requires design modifications. | Provide detailed PUE calculation or energy model including: 1) Assumptions for river water availability and temperature by month, 2) Free cooling operating hours and conditions (e.g., river water < X°C), 3) Chiller efficiency curves and part-load performance, 4) Electrical infrastructure loss calculations, 5) Hour-by-hour or bin analysis using Tbilisi climate data, 6) Impact of direct liquid cooling on facility PUE. This will validate whether 1.5 PUE is achievable or if target should be adjusted based on actual system performance. | Page 3 "Annualized PUE ≤ 1.5"                                                                                       |
| **GGE-CAS-DES-BOD-C02**   | **RAISED FLOOR HEIGHT MARGINAL**: Raised floor specified as 450 mm which is at the low end for high-density data centers, especially with 25 kW/rack AI loads and liquid cooling distribution requiring additional underfloor space for supply/return piping.                                                                       | **MEDIUM**       | Raised floor height impacts: 1) Underfloor airflow velocity and pressure drop (higher velocity = more fan energy), 2) Cable management and installation difficulty, 3) Liquid cooling piping distribution (supply/return headers, branch circuits), 4) Maintenance access, 5) Future flexibility for higher density. 450 mm is minimum for traditional data centers; 600-750 mm is preferred for high-density and liquid-cooled facilities.                                                                                                                 | Increase raised floor height to minimum 600 mm, preferably 750 mm for Quantum AI phase areas with liquid cooling distribution. Maintain 450 mm for Enterprise/VIP/Hub areas if only air cooling is used. Greater height provides: 1) Better airflow performance and lower fan energy, 2) Easier cable management, 3) Space for liquid cooling piping, 4) Improved maintenance access, 5) Future flexibility.                                                                                                                                             | Page 4, Section 3 "Raised floor heights - IT halls: 450 mm"                                                         |
| **GGE-CAS-DES-BOD-C02**   | **NO MENTION OF POWER QUALITY OR HARMONIC MITIGATION**: High-density IT loads (especially AI/HPC) generate significant harmonics and power quality issues. No mention of harmonic filters, K-rated transformers, or power quality specifications.                                                                                   | **MEDIUM**       | Modern IT equipment, especially high-density servers and GPUs, generate significant harmonic distortion (THD can exceed 30-40%). Harmonics cause: 1) Transformer overheating and derating, 2) Neutral conductor overload, 3) UPS input/output distortion, 4) Nuisance breaker tripping, 5) Reduced electrical system lifespan. Ignoring harmonics in design can lead to premature failures and reduced capacity.                                                                                                                                            | Add power quality specifications and mitigation measures: 1) K-13 or K-20 rated transformers for IT loads, 2) Active or passive harmonic filters to maintain THD < 5% at PCC, 3) Oversized neutral conductors (200% of phase current), 4) UPS input harmonic specifications (typically 5-8% THDi), 5) Power quality monitoring and alarming, 6) Voltage regulation and flicker limits.                                                                                                                                                                   | Not addressed in document (omission)                                                                                |
| **GE01-CAS-0004-CO6-C02** | **MECHANICAL SCHEMATIC INCOMPLETE - NO EQUIPMENT SPECIFICATIONS**: Flow diagram shows piping layout but lacks critical equipment specifications including chiller capacity, pump sizes, flow rates, temperatures, pipe sizes for main headers, heat exchanger capacities, and expansion tank sizing calculations.                   | **HIGH**         | Without equipment specifications, the mechanical design cannot be validated for capacity, redundancy, or performance. Critical missing information: 1) Chiller capacity and quantity for N+1 verification, 2) Pump flow rates and head calculations, 3) Primary/secondary loop flow rates and temperatures, 4) Heat exchanger sizing for river water PHE, 5) Expansion tank sizing for system volume and temperature rise, 6) Pipe sizing verification for flow velocity and pressure drop. Design cannot be reviewed for adequacy or Tier III compliance.  | Add comprehensive equipment schedule with mechanical flow diagram including: 1) Chiller make, model, capacity (kW/ton), refrigerant type, 2) Pump specifications (flow GPM/LPM, head, motor HP/kW), 3) System flow rates and temperatures (supply/return for each loop), 4) Heat exchanger capacity and approach temperatures, 5) Expansion tank volume calculations, 6) Main pipe sizes (DN) for all distribution headers, 7) Control valve specifications and locations.                                                                               | Drawing GE01-CAS-0004-CO6-C02, entire drawing lacks equipment tags and specifications                               |
| **GE01-CAS-0004-CO6-C02** | **NO REDUNDANT COOLING PATHS SHOWN**: Mechanical flow diagram shows single-path cooling distribution to multiple IT spaces (V1-V5, E-A, HB) from chiller rooms CRV1 and CRV2. No redundant piping loops or cross-connects visible to provide A/B path redundancy as required for Tier III concurrent maintainability.               | **CRITICAL**     | Tier III requires concurrent maintainability meaning any single cooling distribution path can be isolated for maintenance without impacting IT load. Current single-path design from each chiller room creates single points of failure. If piping in one chiller room requires maintenance, all IT spaces served by that room lose cooling. This violates fundamental Tier III requirement and prevents certification.                                                                                                                                     | Redesign mechanical distribution for A/B path redundancy: 1) Provide dual independent cooling loops to each IT space (Loop A from CRV1, Loop B from CRV2), 2) Add isolation valves to allow maintenance of either loop, 3) Size each loop to carry full cooling load independently (2N capacity), 4) Add cross-connect piping with isolation valves between CRV1 and CRV2 for emergency backup, 5) Show redundant paths clearly on flow diagram with valve numbering and isolation boundaries.                                                           | Drawing GE01-CAS-0004-CO6-C02, piping distribution section showing single feeds to IT rooms                         |
| **GE01-CAS-0004-CO6-C02** | **INADEQUATE EXPANSION TANK SIZING**: Drawing shows multiple 0.5 t (500 L / 132 gal) expansion tanks throughout system. For a 5.6 MW cooling system, total system volume likely 100-150 m³ (26,000-40,000 gal). Rule of thumb: expansion tank volume should be 5-10% of system volume. Current 0.5 t tanks are severely undersized. | **MEDIUM**       | Undersized expansion tanks lead to: 1) Frequent pressure relief valve discharge, 2) Water loss and need for frequent makeup, 3) Pressure fluctuations that can damage equipment, 4) Pump cavitation, 5) System inefficiency and potential air entrainment. Proper expansion tank sizing is essential for system reliability and longevity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Recalculate expansion tank requirements based on: 1) Total system volume including piping, chillers, heat exchangers, and buffer tanks, 2) Maximum system temperature rise (e.g., 5°C to 40°C), 3) Thermal expansion factor for water/glycol mixture (if used), 4) Pre-charge pressure and system operating pressure. Likely result: need for 5-10 m³ (1,300-2,600 gal) expansion vessel per major loop, not 0.5 t per chiller room. Consider bladder-type expansion tanks for closed-loop systems.                                                      | Drawing GE01-CAS-0004-CO6-C02, expansion tank symbols showing "Expansion Tank 0.5 t" throughout                     |
| **GE01-CAS-0004-CO6-C02** | **WATER STORAGE CAPACITY INCONSISTENT**: Drawing shows "Water storage 50 m³ - A1", "Water storage 50 m³ - B1", and "Water storage 125 m³" for river water loop. Total = 225 m³ storage. Purpose and operational strategy unclear - is this thermal storage, emergency backup, or system fill water? No connection to BoD document.  | **MEDIUM**       | Large water storage tanks (225 m³ = 59,000 gallons) represent significant cost and space. Without clear purpose: 1) Cannot verify sizing is adequate for intended function, 2) Cannot assess if storage supports cooling autonomy during river water system maintenance, 3) Cannot determine if related to thermal energy storage for peak shaving, 4) Possible error or misunderstanding of system requirements. Unclear purpose makes it impossible to validate design intent.                                                                            | Clarify purpose and sizing basis for water storage: 1) If thermal storage for demand management, size based on peak load and discharge duration (typically 4-6 hours), 2) If emergency backup for river water system failure, size based on critical cooling runtime until mechanical chillers start (typically 30-60 minutes), 3) If system fill volume, size based on total system volume plus 25% margin, 4) Add description and operational control strategy to mechanical flow diagram and BoD.                                                     | Drawing GE01-CAS-0004-CO6-C02, water storage tanks labeled "Water storage 50 m³" and "Water storage 125 m³"         |
