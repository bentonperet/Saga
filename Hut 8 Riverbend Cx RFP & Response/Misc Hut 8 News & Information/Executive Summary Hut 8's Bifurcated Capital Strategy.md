### **Executive Summary: Hut 8's Bifurcated Capital Strategy**

Hut 8 has executed a strategic bifurcation to fund its distinct business lines: **AI Infrastructure** and **Bitcoin Mining**.

* **AI Infrastructure:** This high-growth division is being funded by **strategic, non-dilutive, and equity-convertible investments** from major tech partners (e.g., Coatue Management). This capital is specifically earmarked for developing large-scale energy and data center assets, most notably the River Bend AI campus.  
* **Bitcoin Mining:** The capital-intensive mining business has been **"carved out" into a new, majority-owned subsidiary, American Bitcoin Corp. (ABTC)**. This structure is designed to make the mining operations self-funding, allowing ABTC to raise its own capital without consuming the parent company's resources, which are now prioritized for AI.  
* **General Liquidity:** Hut 8 leverages its substantial Bitcoin treasury to secure **large, non-dilutive debt facilities** (e.g., from Coinbase and Two Prime), providing broad operational flexibility and working capital.

### **1\. AI Infrastructure Funding**

The primary capital for Hut 8's AI ambitions comes from a single, significant strategic investment.

* **Source:** **Coatue Management, L.L.C.**  
* **Amount:** **$150 Million**  
* **Vehicle:** Convertible Note (announced June 2024).  
* **Conditions & Terms:**  
  * **Purpose:** Explicitly to accelerate the development and deployment of Hut 8's AI infrastructure platform, including the River Bend project.  
  * **Interest Rate:** 8.00% per year, compounded quarterly.  
  * **Term:** An initial five-year term.  
  * **Conversion Price:** The note is convertible into Hut 8 common stock at a price of **$16.395 per share**.

### **2\. Bitcoin Mining Structure & Funding**

Hut 8 has separated its mining operations to insulate its AI-focused balance sheet from the high capital expenditures of mining.

* **Entity:** **American Bitcoin Corp. (ABTC)**  
* **Transaction:** A "cashless merger" (March 2025\) where Hut 8 contributed its mining fleet.  
* **Ownership & Partners:** Hut 8 is the majority owner, holding approximately **80%** of ABTC. The remaining 20% is held by partners, including **Eric Trump** (who serves as Chief Strategy Officer).  
* **Funding Conditions:** ABTC is structured to "raise its own capital" for its operations and future miner purchases. Hut 8 (the parent company) benefits as the majority equity holder and as a service provider (ASIC colocation, managed services) to ABTC.

### **3\. General Corporate & Liquidity Financing**

Hut 8 maintains a flexible balance sheet using its Bitcoin reserves and access to public markets.

* **Source:** **Two Prime Lending Limited**  
  * **Amount:** **$200 Million** (Revolving Credit Facility, August 2025).  
  * **Conditions:** Secured by Bitcoin, 7.99% interest rate.  
* **Source:** **Coinbase**  
  * **Amount:** **$130 Million** (Upsized Credit Facility, 2024/2025).  
  * **Conditions:** Secured by Bitcoin, 9.0% fixed interest rate.  
* **Source:** **Public Equity Markets**  
  * **Amount:** **$1 Billion**  
  * **Vehicle:** At-The-Market (ATM) Equity Program, allowing the company to opportunistically sell shares for capital.

### **4\. River Bend AI Project: Status & Projections**

This is the flagship AI project and the primary use of the AI-related funding. The project is being built on an aggressive timeline, but it is crucial to note that a definitive client lease is not yet finalized.

* **Projected Total Investment:** **$12.5 Billion** (This is a combined projection, not a single valuation).  
  * **Hut 8 Investment (Developer):** **$2.5 Billion** to acquire the 592-acre site and construct the physical data center buildings and power infrastructure.  
  * **Projected Tenant Investment:** **$10 Billion** is the *planned* investment the future tenant is expected to make in hardware (e.g., servers, GPUs).  
* **Delivery Timeframe:**  
  * **Phase 1 (First Building):** Expected to be operational by **late 2025 or early 2026**.  
  * **Phase 2 (Second Building):** Scheduled for completion by the **end of 2026**.  
* **Client Status & Conditions:**  
  * **No Signed Deal:** As of early November 2025, a definitive, binding lease agreement with a hyperscale tenant **has not been signed or publicly announced.**  
  * **Stated Strategy:** Reports from the Q3 2025 earnings call indicate that the stock price was impacted by the lack of a tenant confirmation. CEO Asher Genoot's public stance is that his "focus is squarely on securing the **right tenant, not just the fastest one**," implying Hut 8 can wait for a deal that optimizes long-term economics.
