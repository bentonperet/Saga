1.5 GW+ expansion program accelerates development flywheel, underscores commercial velocity, and supports long runway for growth

Earnings Release Highlights

Revenue of $83.5 million, net income of $50.6 million, and Adjusted EBITDA of $109.0 million.

Total Energy Capacity Under Management1 of 1,020 megawatts (MW) as of September 30, 2025\.

Development pipeline of 8,650 MW as of September 30, 2025, comprising:

5,865 MW of Energy Capacity Under Diligence2,

1,255 MW of Energy Capacity Under Exclusivity3, and

1,530 MW Energy Capacity Under Development4.

Strategic Bitcoin reserve of 13,696 Bitcoin5,6 with a market value of $1.6 billion as of September 30, 2025\.

MIAMI, Nov. 4, 2025 /PRNewswire/ \-- Hut 8 Corp. (Nasdaq, TSX: HUT) ("Hut 8" or the "Company"), an energy infrastructure platform integrating power, digital infrastructure, and compute at scale to fuel next-generation, energy-intensive use cases such as Bitcoin mining and high-performance computing, today reported its financial results for the third quarter of 2025\.

"In the third quarter, we reached an inflection point in the scale and maturity of our development flywheel," said Asher Genoot, CEO of Hut 8\. "We advanced 1,530 megawatts of capacity from exclusivity into development, underscoring both the depth of our pipeline and the scalability of our platform. Subject to commercialization, this portfolio has the potential to expand our Energy Capacity Under Management to more than 2.5 gigawatts, which would mark a step change in the scale and earnings power of our platform."

"The newest stage of our development pipeline, Energy Capacity Under Development, is designed to bridge origination and monetization, creating greater visibility into late-stage projects that have advanced beyond exclusivity. This designation applies to sites where we are executing critical development activities, including the execution of land and power agreements, site design and infrastructure buildout, and engagement with prospective customers. Energy Capacity Under Development converts to Energy Capacity Under Management as it is commercialized."

"As we build on this momentum, our focus remains on monetizing our Energy Capacity Under Development, which together with our broader pipeline, collectively exceed eight gigawatts of capacity as of quarter-end. Supported by a fortress balance sheet, disciplined capital framework, and diversified platform spanning Power, Digital Infrastructure, and Compute, we are executing from a position of strength. Together, we believe these developments reflect a business with structural advantage, proven commercial velocity, and a long runway for continued growth and value creation at the intersection of energy and technology."

Third Quarter 2025 Highlights

Power

Generated $8.4 million in third quarter revenue from Power Generation and Managed Services.

Announced plans to develop four new sites with more than 1.5 GW of total capacity. Subject to commercialization, the platform has the potential to exceed 2.5 GW of Energy Capacity Under Management1 across 19 sites. In connection with the expansion, the Company reclassified 1,530 MW of capacity related to these sites from Energy Capacity Under Exclusivity3 into a new category: Energy Capacity Under Development4.

8,650 MW development pipeline comprising 5,865 MW of Energy Capacity Under Diligence2, 1,255 MW of Energy Capacity Under Exclusivity3, and 1,530 MW of Energy Capacity Under Development4 as of September 30, 2025\.

Digital Infrastructure

Generated $5.1 million in third quarter revenue from Colocation services. In addition, $31.2 million of Colocation revenue from the Company's unconsolidated King Mountain Joint Venture is recognized in the "Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint venture" line item.

Compute

Generated $70.0 million in third quarter revenue from Bitcoin Mining (primarily through the Company's majority-owned subsidiary, American Bitcoin Corp. ("American Bitcoin")), GPU-as-a-Service (through the Company's wholly owned Highrise AI subsidiary), and Data Center Cloud solutions (delivered under the High Performance Computing brand).

Completed the go-public transaction for American Bitcoin, which began trading on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol "ABTC" following the completion of its stock-for-stock merger with Gryphon Digital Mining, Inc.

Select Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results

Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2025 was $83.5 million compared to $43.7 million in the prior year period, and consisted of $8.4 million in Power revenue, $5.1 million in Digital Infrastructure revenue, $70.0 million in Compute revenue, and nil in Other revenue. As American Bitcoin is a consolidated subsidiary, all revenue generated through its Managed Services agreement, ASIC Colocation agreement, and Shared Services agreement are eliminated in consolidation.

Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2025 was $50.6 million compared to $0.9 million for the prior year period. This included gains on digital assets of $76.6 million and losses on digital assets of $1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2025 was $109.0 million compared to $5.6 million for the prior year period. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most comparable GAAP measure, net income, and an explanation of this measure has been provided in the table included below in this press release.

All financial results are reported in U.S. dollars.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward–Looking Information

This press release includes "forward-looking information" and "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Canadian securities laws and United States securities laws, respectively (collectively, "forward-looking information"). All information, other than statements of historical facts, included in this press release that address activities, events, or developments that Hut 8 expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future, including statements relating to the Company's development flywheel, commercial velocity, scalability of its platform, and runway for growth and value creation, the Company's ability to expand its Energy Capacity Under Management, the Company's ability to commercialize and monetize its pipeline, and additional value that may be realized from structured purchase options with Bitmain, and the Company's future business strategy, competitive strengths, expansion, and growth of the business and operations more generally, and other such matters is forward-looking information.

Statements containing forward-looking information are not historical facts, but instead represent management's expectations, estimates, and projections regarding future events based on certain material factors and assumptions at the time the statement was made. While considered reasonable by Hut 8 as of the date of this press release, such statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause the actual results, level of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking information, including, but not limited to, failure of critical systems; geopolitical, social, economic, and other events and circumstances; competition from current and future competitors; risks related to power requirements; cybersecurity threats and breaches; hazards and operational risks; changes in leasing arrangements; Internet-related disruptions; dependence on key personnel; having a limited operating history; attracting and retaining customers; entering into new offerings or lines of business; price fluctuations and rapidly changing technologies; construction of new data centers, data center expansions, or data center redevelopment; predicting facility requirements; strategic alliances or joint ventures; operating and expanding internationally; failing to grow hashrate; purchasing miners; relying on third-party mining pool service providers; uncertainty in the development and acceptance of the Bitcoin network; Bitcoin halving events; competition from other methods of investing in Bitcoin; concentration of Bitcoin holdings; hedging transactions; potential liquidity constraints; legal, regulatory, governmental, and technological uncertainties; physical risks related to climate change; involvement in legal proceedings; trading volatility; and other risks described from time to time in Company's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In particular, see the Company's recent and upcoming annual and quarterly reports and other continuous disclosure documents, which are available under the Company's EDGAR profile at www.sec.gov and SEDAR+ profile at www.sedarplus.ca.

Adjusted EBITDA

In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we rely on Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our business, measure our performance, and make strategic decisions. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income, adjusted for impacts of interest expense, income tax provision or benefit, depreciation and amortization, gain on debt extinguishment, our share of unconsolidated joint venture depreciation and amortization, net of basis adjustments, foreign exchange gain or loss, gain or loss on sale of property and equipment, gain or loss on derivatives, gain or loss on other financial liability, gain or loss on warrant liability, the removal of non-recurring transactions, income or loss attributable to non-controlling interests, and stock-based compensation expense in the period presented. You are encouraged to evaluate each of these adjustments and the reasons our Board and management team consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis.

The Company's board of directors and management team use Adjusted EBITDA to assess its financial performance because it allows them to compare operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of capital structure (such as varying levels of interest expense and income), asset base (such as depreciation and amortization), and other items (such as non-recurring transactions mentioned above) that impact the comparability of financial results from period to period.

Net income (loss) is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in such presentation. The Company's presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. There can be no assurance that the Company will not modify the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA in the future, and any such modification may be material. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in the industry, the Company's definition of this non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility.

[Hut 8 Momentum Seems Finally Broken As Operating Profitability Eludes](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4838034-hut-8-momentum-seems-finally-broken-as-operating-profitability-eludes)

Summary

Hut 8 (HUT) has surged in price but remains reliant on Bitcoin appreciation, lacking true operating profitability from its core or side businesses.

Despite beating Q3 earnings estimates, HUT's share price dropped, signaling waning market momentum and growing skepticism about its business model.

Dilution remains a concern, with HUT funding operations by issuing new shares rather than utilizing its Bitcoin reserves, worsening its balance sheet.

I downgrade HUT to a hold with a bias toward sell, urging profit-taking and caution due to persistent operational losses and premium valuation over Bitcoin.

Bitcoin mining farm. IT hardware.

Back in January I went with what I thought was a rather unusual topic, Hut 8 (HUT), a company I rated a buy based on encouraging reports about their attempts at energy optimization and the introduction of a GPU-as-a-service side business. That stock has done incredibly well since then.

Though the price has obviously surged in recent months, it looks like a very different company in November than it did in January, having moved to increase their energy capacity in recent months and, more importantly, creating a majority-owned subsidiary that went public in the form of American Bitcoin (ABTC).

Perhaps most importantly, though, is that we just had the Q3 earnings report from Hut 8, and while they beat on both EPS and revenue, the stock price also dropped pretty substantially, suggesting that the market’s love affair with the company’s momentum may finally be broken.

There’s a lot to talk about here but most important is the earnings. Let’s see what it does, and doesn’t, show.

Growth Continues But Operating Profitability Eludes Them

Hut 8 is a strange beast in 2025, as they remain profitable on paper, but when you look at the earnings there is a persistent problem that they don’t seem to be able to shake.

2024 (First 3 Q’s)

2025 (First 3 Q’s)

(source: most recent 10-Q from SEC)

The problem, in short, is that while the company is booking substantial gains in digital assets, which is to say the value of Bitcoin has gone up, those gains are actually bigger than the overall net income of the entire company, in 2025 dramatically so. In short, Hut 8 is not making any real operating profit through their day-to-day operations, but actually a significant operating loss that’s being papered over by appreciation in the value of their digital assets.

That happened in 2024 as well, and I noted it in January, but the hope at the time was that the company’s side businesses and optimization were such that they would grow into a business that could sustain itself on something other than Bitcoin going up in price. The 2025 numbers show that has yet to happen, and if anything has gotten quite a bit worse.

The rate of growth has also worsened, as estimated 2025 revenue was revised downward substantially from where we were in January, and 2026 revenue is following suit. 2027 revenue is expected to be enormously higher, but seems a lot less certain, as that far out in this industry is all but impossible to project.

What we’re left with at the moment is a Hut 8 that was able to book pretty good paper gains on their digital assets, but the cost of the various other things they’re doing or attempting to do exceeds the money they’re bringing in. In January I called Hut 8 “more than a Bitcoin miner,” but in a way, the more is a liability.

Dilution, the Ongoing Concern

There’s another problem here, and that’s dilution. My hope was that with their large reserve of Bitcoin was giving them room for an operating budget as they grow, and that the previous years of dilution to fund day-to-day operations were coming to an end. That, however, is not what we’re getting.

In January Hut 8 has 93.5 million shares outstanding, and a slew of Bitcoins on the balance sheet. Today’s 10-Q shows over 108 million shares outstanding despite those digital asset gains, and the company bragging of being able to secure a good price when they issue new shares of the company as evidence of their patience.

While they are able to get a premium to their underlying book value for the shares, and that’s not necessarily a bad thing, Hut 8 seems to prefer to keep funding their unprofitable day-to-day operations by issuing more shares, rather than taking some profits by selling some of their hoard of Bitcoins. Seemingly that’s the one thing they’re unwilling to do.

While Hut 8 has been slowly growing revenue, the balance sheet is seemingly getting worse. I wasn’t so worried about the iffy current ratio of 1.0 in January because I believed the large Bitcoin reserve was something of a backstop. That’s only true if they’re willing to use it, however, and with the current ratio down to 0.72, we might well see further dilution on the horizon.

My concern, in short, is that a share of Hut 8 stock represents in the ballpark of $13 worth of Bitcoin and a business that seemingly can only book a profit when the price of the Bitcoin appreciates. If that problem persists, the question is how long we can justify paying 3.6 times premium for the underlying Bitcoin when it’s tied to an otherwise unprofitable venture. That’s not a problem unique to Hut 8, of course, but I’ve yet to hear a good answer for why such premiums are justified compared to investing directly in Bitcoin if one is bullish about the price.

The Growth of the Energy Business

The side business Hut 8 seems most interested in of late is buying up cheap energy capacity, with plans to more than double their capacity under management with four new sites representing over 1.5 GW in capacity.

These sites are heavily centered around Texas, which is 1.18 GW of the new capacity, with the remainder involving 300 MW in Louisiana and another 50 MW in Illinois. Assuming they are able to get this new capacity commercialized at the same high rate we’ve seen of late, that could increase the scale of this aspect of the business by quite a bit, but at the same time, the revenue for the power side of the business was only $18.2 million, 15% of total revenue, so far in 2025 to begin with, so this is not likely to be a huge driver of revenue growth even at higher scale.

Hut 8 is ambitious about growing the capacity quite a bit further than this, and it remains possible they will be able to do so in a way that makes them a profit on this particular side business. It is difficult to envision them being able to do so at such a vast scale as to make this a big part of the overall operations, however.

Is the Momentum Gone?

Surging from $11 per share to over $50 this past week, Hut 8 had quite a run as a momentum stock, with excitement fueling price increases and yet more excitement. If market sentiment was where it was during this huge increase in share prices and Hut 8 came in beating both revenue and earnings estimates as they just did, one would expect a further rally. Instead we saw a 12% drop in share price. To me this suggests that the market may be getting beyond the exuberance around the company and starting to ask more questions about where the underlying business is going. That’s certainly where I’m at at the moment.

That’s not to say that things couldn’t change at a moment’s notice once again, with the underlying Bitcoin price always subject to fluctuation. Since the Bitcoin on the balance sheet amounts to most of Hut 8’s underlying value, the risk and the potential gains are both inexorably tied to the price of Bitcoin. It could be that the cryptocurrency itself could start rising again, and the excitement surrounding that could restart the momentum behind Hut 8\. If Bitcoin is more or less stabilized, however, I think the questions about the premium Hut 8 shares command will loom large.

Might Be Time to Take Profits

I was enthusiastic about Hut 8 in January and the price went up. I now feel like I was right but for the wrong reasons, that the company was rather cheap at the time, but the underlying business was not, as it turns out, on the cusp of improving.

With a much higher share price and less conviction that the underlying business is ever going to be profitable beyond Bitcoin gains, I’m going to revise my rating downward to hold, with a bias toward sell. Those that bought at lower prices may want to consider taking the profit, and those using Hut 8 to play the Bitcoin market may do well to find something with less of a premium behind it.

Investors should keep a close eye on Bitcoin prices, naturally, but should also track the difference between gains on digital assets and net income for the entire business, because so long as the former remains higher than the latter, I believe Hut 8 has some substantial problems.

Hut 8 may well be more than the Bitcoin miner, but the more may not be all that desirable at the end of the day.

HPC and cryptomine data center developer Hut 8 has announced plans for new projects across the US.

The company this week announced plans to develop four new sites across the United States, totaling 1.53GW of capacity under development.

– Hut 8

The expansion sites range in scale from 50MW to 1GW of utility capacity across Louisiana, Texas, and Illinois.

Upon commercialization of the sites, Hut 8 said it expects its platform to exceed 2.5GW of capacity under management across 19 sites.

“This expansion marks a defining step in Hut 8’s evolution into one of the largest energy and digital infrastructure platforms in the world,” said Asher Genoot, CEO of Hut 8\. “By advancing more than 1.5GW of capacity from exclusivity into development, we position ourselves to more than double the scale of our platform and address accelerating demand across energy-intensive use cases.”

Genoot added: “In addition to driving scale, this expansion is designed to broaden our geographic footprint as we seek to capture opportunities in markets where we see energy demand rising most rapidly. Importantly, it represents just the first phase of execution against a multi-gigawatt energy origination pipeline that underpins our long-term growth trajectory.”

In total, Hut 8 claims to have 10.6GW of capacity in various stages of its pipeline. It has around 1GW in operation, 1.5GW in development, 1.25GW under exclusivity, and a further 6.8GW under evaluation.

In Louisiana, the River Bend Project will total 300MW. In Illinois, ‘Project 4’ will total 50MW. In Texas, projects 2 and 3 will total 1GW and 180MW, respectively.

Timelines for development on each weren’t shared. Hut 8 recently told DCD that its latest data center design enables flexibility to host either crypto or HPC hardware with minimal changes.

Hut 8 acquired 592 acres in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in March.

Nasdaq-listed Hut 8 currently has more than 19 data center sites either in operation or in development, including ten Bitcoin mining projects, five high-performance computing data centers, and four power-generation assets. The company acquired five colo data centers in Canada from TeraGo in 2022, and merged with US Bitcoin in 2023\. Hut 8 also offers GPU-as-a-Service through its Highrise brand.

Hut 8 acquired a majority stake in American Data Centers in April, joining forces with its management team, which includes the son of President Donald Trump, Eric Trump. Upon completion of the merger, the combined company will operate under the American Bitcoin brand. The cryptomining unit is set to go public via a merger with cryptocurrency mining firm Gryphon Digital. Hut 8 is set to continue hosting American Bitcoin’s hardware in its data centers.

Hut 8 said it has assets and available financing arrangements supporting up to $2.4 billion in liquidity, including cash, Bitcoin, credit, and its at-the-market (ATM) equity program. This includes more than 10,000 Bitcoin, a $200 million revolving credit facility, and a $1bn ATM program.

This month’s Q2 2025 quarterly earnings saw Hut 8 post revenue of $41.3m, net income of $137.5m, and Adjusted EBITDA of $221.2m.

**“We made significant progress in February across every layer of our platform, from expanding our footprint to developing digital infrastructure and upgrading our ASIC fleet,” said Asher Genoot, CEO of Hut 8, in the firm’s Q4 operations update.**

**“In our power layer, we secured 592 acres in Louisiana for our newest River Bend campus. The site is expected to support a 300-megawatt utility-scale power asset with 200 megawatts of dedicated IT load."**

**Reports that Hut 8 was looking to develop in the area, located just outside Baton Rouge, surfaced at the end of last year. The company got the green light from local officials for a data center project in January.**

**Previous reports suggest the project will feature two 450,000 sq ft (41,800 sqm) facilities in the first phase, with construction set to be completed by Q4 2025\. The second phase will see additional data centers constructed by the end of 2026\.**

**Hut 8 currently has 19 data center sites either in operation or in development, including ten Bitcoin mining projects, five high-performance computing data centers, and four power-generation assets.**

**Its 205MW ‘Vega’ site is set to launch later this year. Located in the Texas Panhandle, Vega will feature a custom rack-based, direct-to-chip liquid-cooling system designed for Bitmain’s ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) miners.**

**In Q4 of 2024, Hut 8 entered into a working partnership with Bitmain to secure \~15 EHps of dedicated Bitcoin mining capacity through the hardware company’s new U3S21EXPH mining rigs, which are set for deployment at the Vega site.**

**“Our Vega development remains on schedule for Q2 energization. Miner deliveries for our \~15 EHps ASIC Colocation agreement with BITMAIN are underway, and as we prepare for energization,” said Genoot.**

**In December 2024, Hut 8 initiated a controlled equity offering SM sales agreement to secure funding for the expansion of its data centers. In June 2024, Hut 8 secured a $150 million investment from a fund managed by Coatue Management, LLC., to expand its AI-specific operations.**
