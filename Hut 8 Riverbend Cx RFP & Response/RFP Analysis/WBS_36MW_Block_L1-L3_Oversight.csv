OVERSIGHT SCOPE DEFINITION (PER RFP),,,,,,,,,,

CxA Oversight Activities,GC Execution Activities,CxA Deliverables,,

"Review and approve GC commissioning plan, schedule, and procedures",Execute all L1-L3 commissioning activities,Level 1 Submittal Review Report,,
Review equipment submittals and O&M documentation,Submit equipment documentation for CxA review,Level 2 Installation Verification Report,,
Witness and verify physical equipment installation (sampling),Perform 100% equipment installation per design,Level 3 Pre-Functional Testing Oversight Report,,
Define witness points for pre-functional testing,Perform all pre-functional testing per approved procedures,Punch list of deficiencies requiring resolution,,
Witness critical pre-functional tests,Provide test reports to CxA for review,Readiness assessment for Level 4 commissioning,,
Review GC test reports for non-witnessed testing,Resolve all deficiencies before L4 handoff,Weekly progress reports and issues log,,
Document deficiencies and punch list items,Coordinate vendor startup and support,Photo documentation of key installations,,
Approve readiness for Level 4 commissioning,Achieve substantial completion of installation and L3 testing,Final L1-L3 phase report,,

Note: "Oversight" means CxA reviews GC work product and witnesses critical activities but does not perform hands-on L1-L3 commissioning,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,

TAG APPROVAL AUTHORITY (PER RFI-001.02),,,,,,,,,,

Question: Will CxA have tag approval authority for equipment/system turnover from L3 to L4?,,,,,,,,,,

Scenario A: CxA has tag approval authority,,,,,,,,,,
,"If CxA has authority to approve equipment tags, then CxA must verify all L1-L3 activities substantially complete before issuing tag approval for L4 commissioning to proceed. This increases CxA oversight responsibility.",,,,,,,,

Scenario B: Owner retains tag approval authority,,,,,,,,,,
,"If Owner retains authority, CxA provides recommendation only. Owner makes final approval decision for L3→L4 handoff. This reduces CxA responsibility but may create ambiguity in handoff criteria.",,,,,,,,

Assumption for this WBS: CxA provides readiness recommendation; final approval authority TBD per RFI-001.02 response,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,

ASSUMPTIONS & NOTES - L1-L3 OVERSIGHT,,,,,,,,,,

,1. L1-L3 duration: 5 weeks based on industry standards for 36 MW data hall (RFP does not specify L1-L3 duration),,,,,,,,
,2. GC performs all L1-L3 commissioning execution; CxA provides oversight per RFP scope definition,,,,,,,,
,3. 4 resources adequate for oversight role: 2 site-based leads + 2 remote/hybrid management/documentation,,,,,,,,
,4. Witness point strategy used for L3 pre-functional testing (not 100% witness of all tests),,,,,,,,
,5. Statistical sampling used for repetitive equipment verification (e.g. 351 battery cabinets),,,,,,,,
,6. Documentation Coordinator at full-time (50 hrs/week) during L1-L3 due to heavy submittal review workload,,,,,,,,
,7. Pressure testing and TAB performed by others; CxA oversight and plan review only per scope assumptions,,,,,,,,
,8. CxA tag approval authority TBD per RFI-001.02 - impacts L3→L4 handoff responsibility,,,,,,,,
,9. Hours assume GC has commissioning experience and provides quality work product requiring normal oversight,,,,,,,,
,10. If GC commissioning quality is poor, oversight hours may increase significantly (risk factor),,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,

RISKS - L1-L3 OVERSIGHT PHASE,,,,,,,,,,

Risk,Probability,Impact,Consequence,Mitigation

GC Lacks Commissioning Experience,MEDIUM,HIGH,"Poor quality L1-L3 execution, extensive rework, delays to L4 start",Qualify GC commissioning experience early; escalate issues immediately; budget contingency hours
GC Schedule Delays,HIGH,HIGH,L4 start delayed - cascades through entire block schedule,"Track GC progress weekly, early warning system, contractual L3 completion requirements"
Submittal Delays,MEDIUM,MEDIUM,Cannot complete L1 review on schedule,"Request submittals 4-6 weeks before installation, track submittal log aggressively"
Installation Deficiencies,HIGH,MEDIUM,"Extensive punch list, delays to L3 pre-functional testing","Conduct L2 verification early and often, halt work if major deficiencies found"
Incomplete Pre-Functional Testing,MEDIUM,HIGH,"Equipment not ready for L4, CxA cannot approve handoff","Define witness points and hold points clearly upfront, do not approve L3 completion until substantially complete"
Scope Ambiguity (L1-3 Oversight Definition),HIGH,MEDIUM,"Cost overrun if oversight effort exceeds estimate, dispute over responsibility","RFI-001.02 requests clarification; define oversight scope clearly in proposal assumptions"

Overall Risk: MEDIUM-HIGH due to dependency on GC quality and RFI-001.02 scope ambiguity,,,,,,,,,,
