**RE: Proposal for Commissioning Services - Riverbend Data Center (224 MW)**

Dear [Client Name],

**Riverbend's success demands three non-negotiable outcomes: schedule certainty, first-time quality, and cost predictability.** The critical importance of this project to Hut 8's growth strategy and the aggressive timeline required to achieve commercial operation leave no margin for error. This proposal demonstrates how the right commissioning approach delivers all three.

**Your project requires the same caliber of oversight that top hyperscale operators demand for their most critical infrastructure.** The world's most demanding infrastructure operators don't rely solely on their primary commissioning contractors—no matter how experienced. They engage independent Owner's Agent oversight to catch critical safety issues, integration gaps, and operational defects that even experienced commissioning agents miss. On average, this level of oversight identifies **45-60 significant findings per project** that the primary CxA missed, preventing **$500K-$2M in avoided rework, downtime, and safety incidents.**

**Riverbend deserves this same level of protection—whether through primary commissioning excellence or independent Owner's Agent oversight.**

**Riverbend is not a standard deployment.** A 224 MW, first-of-a-kind facility with liquid cooling infrastructure, aggressive 6-week IST timelines, and phased delivery across six data halls presents complexity that demands more than conventional commissioning. **More importantly, Riverbend represents Hut 8's entry into the hyperscale infrastructure market—a market where execution capability, not just power availability, determines competitive success.**

Your project requires a commissioning partner who can move at startup speed, anticipate integration challenges before they become schedule delays, and ensure every system operates safely from day one. **But beyond technical excellence, your facility needs validation from a partner whose credibility instantly signals capability to sophisticated infrastructure buyers.** First impressions with Tier-1 clients are permanent—there are no second chances.

**This proposal offers three engagement pathways:**

1. **Primary Commissioning Agent** - Direct engagement of the firm that hyperscalers trust to QA their CxAs, with full responsibility for L1-L5 commissioning.

2. **Owner's Agent / QA Oversight** ⭐ **(Recommended if selecting a larger firm)** - Engage a large firm for primary CxA work with independent oversight and QA to ensure nothing is missed.

3. **Large Firm Only** - Traditional approach with no independent verification (Not recommended for a first-of-a-kind facility).

**Why does this matter for Riverbend?** This is Hut 8's first liquid-cooled facility at this scale and your flagship project as you scale to 2.5+ GW of infrastructure capacity. First-of-a-kind projects consistently reveal integration issues, installation defects, and operational safety concerns that aren't visible during design or construction.

**But Riverbend's stakes go beyond technical execution.** Your prospective clients—Tier-1 hyperscale operators with stringent quality requirements—will evaluate this facility as proof of your capability to meet their standards. They will review your commissioning methodology during due diligence. They will ask: "Who provides independent verification? What is your first-time quality track record?" **Your answer needs to demonstrate the same oversight standard they use themselves**—engaging the firm they hire to QA their own CxAs. This instantly signals you operate at their level, accelerating contract negotiations and reducing perceived risk.

**Independent Owner's Agent oversight—in either role—provides the verification and proactive problem-solving that protects your $2.5 billion investment and validates your capability to compete at the highest level.**

**What Riverbend requires:**

- **Owner's Agent Expertise That Uncovers What Others Miss:** As Owner's Agent specialists, this engagement is fundamentally about uncovering hidden things—safety issues, integration gaps, installation defects that aren't visible during design or construction. 100% of hyperscale projects reveal safety issues the primary CxA missed. Your first-of-a-kind facility demands this level of scrutiny.

- **Proactive QA/QC That Prevents Delays:** Catching issues during L1-L3 before they become L4-L5 delays. Projects with this oversight achieve 95% first-time functional test pass rates vs. 60-75% industry average—directly protecting your aggressive 6-week IST timeline.

- **Real-Time Schedule Risk Management with Dedicated P6 Scheduling SME:** Your highly variable and dynamic schedule requires precision management. Proprietary project controls platform integrates with Primavera P6, Procore, CxAlloy, and BIM 360 to provide live commissioning dashboards, smart scheduling algorithms, and automated executive reporting. A dedicated **Mission-Critical Project Controls & Scheduling SME** (30-year career spanning Tesla, Lockheed, DOE programs) tracks 200+ dependencies, float optimization, and critical path protection.

- **Technology-Enabled Excellence:** A single source of truth across your entire project ecosystem, eliminating the chaos of disconnected spreadsheets and email threads. Automated milestone tracking, risk-scored scheduling, and real-time stakeholder dashboards ensure complete transparency—exactly what you need for investor and client confidence.

- **Liquid Cooling Expertise:** Deep experience with CDU systems, two-phase cooling, and Vertiv OFC/XDU equipment across hyperscale deployments—critical for your first-of-a-kind liquid cooling implementation.

**Cultural Alignment:** Hut 8 operates at startup velocity—fast decisions, data-driven problem solving, and technology-forward thinking. Your commissioning partner must match that pace. **24/7 access to live dashboards showing exactly where the project stands in the schedule, what issues need attention, and predictive analytics forecasting delays 2-3 weeks before they impact milestones.** No waiting for weekly reports—real-time visibility into commissioning status at your fingertips.

**The Team:** [Lead Cx Manager Name] serving as Program Manager, supported by [Electrical Lead Name] and [Mechanical Lead Name] who have commissioned [X] MW of hyperscale capacity including [specific relevant projects]. Site crews trained in Owner's Agent oversight for top hyperscale operators—they know what world-class quality looks like.

**This proposal includes:**

- **Section 1: Executive Summary** - Understanding of your priorities and how this approach addresses them
- **Section 2: Technical Approach** - Detailed methodology for L1-L5 commissioning and QA/QC
- **Section 3: Project Schedule** - Phasing plan aligned to your milestone dates
- **Section 4: Staffing Plan** - Dedicated resources and escalation protocols
- **Section 5: Pricing** - Three engagement options with transparent cost drivers
- **Section 6: Assumptions** - Clear scope boundaries and commercial terms
- **Section 7: Qualifications** - Relevant project experience and client references

**Pricing structured to provide flexibility:**

- **Primary CxA Engagement:** $[X.X]M - $[X.X]M (base scope + options)
- **Owner's Agent QA Oversight:** $[XXX]K - $[XXX]K (three tiers based on involvement level)
- **Unit pricing schedule** included for scope adjustments as design evolves

**Pricing based on White Space Option 2 (most extensive configuration) and assumes:**
- 6-week L4-L5 duration per 36 MW block (4-5 weeks L4 + 1-2 weeks L5)
- No overlapping L4-L5 phases (sequential commissioning of six blocks)
- GC performs L1-L3 activities with independent oversight (25-30% effort level)
- Air/liquid load banks and TAB services provided by others

**Three Critical Questions Require Clarification** (submitted under separate RFI):
- **RFI-001.01:** Switchyard commissioning scope and timeline (CRITICAL PATH, $400K-$1.5M variance)
- **RFI-001.02:** Controls and monitoring systems (BMS, EPMS, DCIM, SCADA vendors)
- **RFI-001.03:** QA/QC scope definition (critical infrastructure vs. general construction)

Responses to these questions will enable refined final pricing and eliminate uncertainty in scope.

**Whether engaging a primary commissioning agent or an Owner's Agent quality assurance partner, Riverbend benefits from the same expertise that protects hyperscale operators' most critical infrastructure.** This approach ensures your facility achieves commercial operation on schedule, operates safely, and performs as designed.

**More importantly, this approach ensures Riverbend becomes the proof point you need**—demonstrating to your prospective clients, investors, and the market that Hut 8 executes world-class infrastructure at hyperscale standards. That credibility is worth far more than the commissioning investment.

We welcome the opportunity to discuss this proposal in detail and answer any questions. Please contact me directly at [phone] or [email].

Thank you for considering this approach for Riverbend.
