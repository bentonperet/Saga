## 10. UNANSWERED QUESTIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS

### Critical Unanswered Questions

**Utility Interconnection:**
1. What is the exact utility service voltage? (115kV? 230kV? Higher?)
2. Where is the demarcation point between Entergy-owned and Hut 8-owned equipment?
3. How is the 300 MW capacity allocated from River Bend's 974 MW total output?
4. Is this a dedicated feed or shared grid capacity?

**Grid Configuration:**
5. Is the utility service radial, loop, or network configuration?
6. What redundancy exists at the utility interconnection level?
7. Are there dual utility feeds from separate River Bend switchyard buses?

**Nuclear Plant Coordination:**
8. What happens during River Bend refueling outages (~30 days every 18-24 months)?
9. Is backup power drawn from Entergy's natural gas generation during nuclear outages?
10. What are the utility SLA terms and reliability guarantees?

### Recommendations for Further Investigation

**1. Submit RFI-001.01 Immediately**
- Clarify switchyard scope, utility voltage, equipment responsibilities
- Address $400K-$1.5M cost variance
- Critical for accurate proposal pricing

**2. Request Utility Interconnection Agreement**
- Understand exact power delivery terms
- Clarify demarcation point and responsibilities
- Review SLA and reliability guarantees

**3. Investigate River Bend Refueling Schedule**
- Nuclear plants require ~30-day refueling outages every 18-24 months
- Understand backup power arrangements during outages
- Validate grid stability and redundancy

**4. Validate Carbon-Free Power Claims**
- Confirm percentage of power from nuclear vs. natural gas
- Understand grid mix at point of interconnection
- Support ESG and sustainability reporting

## FINAL SUMMARY

**Yes, you were told correctly: The Hut 8 Riverbend data center is powered by nuclear energy.**

Specifically, the facility draws **300 MW of utility power from Entergy Louisiana, which operates the adjacent River Bend Nuclear Generating Station (974 MW capacity)**. Multiple sources explicitly confirm that Hut 8 selected this site for **"proximity to River Bend's 974 MW capacity"** and **"access to excess energy generated by this lower carbon emissions source."**

This provides Hut 8 with:
- **Zero-carbon baseload nuclear power**
- **Existing excess capacity** (no new generation construction)
- **Accelerated project timeline**
- **Strong ESG and sustainability profile**

The River Bend Nuclear Station is a 974 MW GE boiling water reactor that has been operating since 1986 and has its license extended through 2045. It provides 8-10% of Louisiana's total energy demand and is owned/operated by Entergy Louisiana.

**This is the only Hut 8 data center site with direct access to dedicated nuclear power**, making it unique within their portfolio and strategically valuable for carbon-free AI/HPC workloads.
