## SECTION 1: Schedule & Phasing

### Q1.1 - Switchyard Commissioning Timeline (CRITICAL)
**Question:** The RFP states switchyard commissioning occurs May 2026 - July 2026, with 300 MW utility power available from August 2026 onward per the ramp schedule.

a) Is the switchyard commissioning completion (July 2026) intended to align with utility energization, or will the utility be energized earlier?

b) What is the required completion date for switchyard commissioning to support Data Hall 1 commissioning start in August 2026?

c) Will any portion of the switchyard need to be commissioned and operational before July 2026 to support early data hall construction power?

**Rationale:** Establishes critical path dependencies and mobilization timing.

---

### Q1.2 - Level 4 IST Duration Constraint (CRITICAL)
**Question:** The RFP specifies "Level 4 - IST Duration: No more than six (6) weeks per 36 MW block."

a) Does this 6-week constraint apply to Level 4 functional testing only, or to the combined duration of Level 4 + Level 5 + IST?

b) Is the 6-week period measured from start of CxA-led functional testing to completion of all IST, or is it the duration of the IST phase only?

c) Are there intermediate milestones within the 6-week period (e.g., substantial completion, critical systems operational)?

**Rationale:** Significantly impacts staffing levels, cost, and feasibility. As written, 6 weeks for full Levels 4-5 + IST is extremely aggressive for a 36 MW data center block.

---

### Q1.3 - Commissioning Phase Overlaps (HIGH)
**Question:** The ramp schedule shows data halls starting commissioning every 2 months with 2-month commissioning durations, creating overlaps where up to 3-4 blocks could be active simultaneously.

a) Is it acceptable for the same commissioning agent to manage multiple overlapping blocks with different commissioning teams, or do you prefer dedicated project managers per block?

b) What are the expectations for CxA site presence during overlapping phases? (e.g., one lead CxA and multiple field teams, or separate CxA leads per block?)

c) Can Level 1-3 oversight activities be scheduled flexibly to optimize resource allocation across blocks?

**Rationale:** Defines staffing model and cost structure for overlapping phases.

---

### Q1.4 - Construction Schedule Relationship (HIGH)
**Question:**
a) What is the anticipated relationship between substantial completion and commissioning start for each data hall? (e.g., commissioning starts at 90% construction complete?)
