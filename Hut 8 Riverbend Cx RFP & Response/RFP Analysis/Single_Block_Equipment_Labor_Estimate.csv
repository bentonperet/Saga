SCHEDULE RISK ASSESSMENT,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Risk Factor,Impact,Likelihood,Mitigation Strategy,,,,,,

GC L3 Completion Delays,HIGH,MEDIUM,"Level 4 cannot start until L3 substantially complete. Build 1-week buffer into schedule. Include contractual language about GC readiness",,,,,,
Weather Delays (Outdoor Equipment),MEDIUM,HIGH,"Louisiana weather: Plan outdoor testing early in schedule. Have indoor backup tasks ready. 10% contingency built into schedule",,,,,,
Vendor Support Delays,MEDIUM,MEDIUM,"Pre-coordinate vendor startup schedules 4-6 weeks in advance. Have vendor SOWs signed before L4 start",,,,,,
Equipment Deficiencies,MEDIUM,HIGH,"15% retest contingency built in. Maintain punch list tracking. Work with GC to resolve issues during L4 (not after)",,,,,,
Utility/Switchyard Delays,CRITICAL,MEDIUM,"Switchyard must be energized before data hall L4 start. Any switchyard delay cascades to all blocks. Monitor closely during Phase 0",,,,,,

NOTES AND ASSUMPTIONS,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"1. Hours assume equipment has been properly energized and Level 3 (Pre-Functional Testing) completed by GC",,,,,,,,,,
,"2. Mechanical systems represent 62% of total labor due to chiller testing, CDU commissioning, and CRAH balancing complexity",,,,,,,,,,
,"3. Electrical work is more straightforward with shorter per-unit testing times once equipment is energized",,,,,,,,,,
,"4. Level 4 duration: 5 weeks for functional testing with 10-person crew",,,,,,,,,,
,"5. Level 5 duration: 1.5 weeks for integrated systems testing (can be compressed to 1 week if needed)",,,,,,,,,,
,"6. Total target duration: 6.5 weeks provides realistic schedule; 6 weeks achievable with good execution",,,,,,,,,,
,"7. Overhead includes daily coordination meetings, weekly reporting, test documentation, vendor coordination",,,,,,,,,,
,"8. 15% contingency for equipment deficiencies is based on typical data center commissioning punch list rates",,,,,,,,,,
,"9. Battery testing uses statistical sampling per IEEE standards (not full discharge of all 351 cabinets)",,,,,,,,,,
,"10. Pressure testing, flush & fill, and test and balancing (TAB) of liquid/liquid and liquid/air equipment performed by others; PGCIS provides oversight and documentation review only",,,,,,,,,,
,"11. Air and liquid load banks provided and operated by others; PGCIS provides load bank plan review and oversight only",,,,,,,,,,
,"12. Hours do NOT include hands-on pressure testing, flushing, filling, or TAB activities - oversight and witnessing only",,,,,,,,,,
