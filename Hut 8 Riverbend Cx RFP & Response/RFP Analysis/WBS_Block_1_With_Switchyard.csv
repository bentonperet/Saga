Risk,Probability,Impact,Consequence,Mitigation Strategy,,,,,,,,

Switchyard Utility Delays,MEDIUM,CRITICAL,Delays all data hall blocks,"Aggressive coordination, early utility engagement, dual crew acceleration capability",,,,,,,,
Switchyard Weather Delays,HIGH,HIGH,Schedule slip during May-Jul (hurricane season),Build 1-week weather contingency into switchyard schedule,,,,,,,,
Switchyard Scope Ambiguity,HIGH,CRITICAL,"Cost variance $400K-$1.5M, schedule unknown",RFI-001.07 CRITICAL question must be answered before pricing finalized,,,,,,,,
GC L3 Completion Delays,MEDIUM,HIGH,L4 start delayed - cascades through Block 1,"Dual crew model allows surge support, early GC coordination, contractual L3 completion requirements",,,,,,,,
Equipment Deficiencies (Block 1),HIGH,MEDIUM,Retest time extends schedule,15% contingency built in; dual crews provide surge capacity for retest,,,,,,,,
Vendor Support Delays,MEDIUM,MEDIUM,Testing delays if vendor unavailable,"Pre-schedule vendor support 4-6 weeks in advance, dual crews can work around vendor delays",,,,,,,,
Load Bank Unavailability,LOW,HIGH,Cannot complete L5 IST,"Contractually require load banks from Owner/others, confirm availability 6 weeks before L5",,,,,,,,
Holiday Impacts,LOW,LOW,Labor Day during Block 1 L4 startup,Minimal impact - single holiday. Adjust startup to avoid Sep 1 if feasible.,,,,,,,,

Overall Risk: MEDIUM-HIGH for Switchyard (critical path + scope ambiguity). MEDIUM for Block 1 (standard commissioning risks with dual crew mitigation).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
