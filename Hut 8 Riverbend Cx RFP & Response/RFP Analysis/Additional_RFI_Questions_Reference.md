## DOCUMENT USAGE NOTES

### When to Use These Questions

1. **Contract Negotiation:** If selected as finalist, use these questions to clarify scope details during contract discussions
2. **Proposal Interview/Presentation:** If shortlisted for interview, prepare responses to these questions as they may be asked
3. **Internal Proposal Development:** Use as reference for making reasonable assumptions in proposal
4. **Change Order Justification:** If scope changes arise, reference these questions to demonstrate areas of ambiguity
5. **Follow-up RFI:** If primary RFI (RFI-001) responses create need for additional clarification

### Prioritization for Follow-up

If opportunity arises to ask follow-up questions, prioritize in this order:
1. **Switchyard L1-3 responsibilities** (if not answered in RFI-001)
2. **IST scenario requirements** (impacts 6-week schedule significantly)
3. **Controls system vendor/version details** (if not answered in RFI-001)
4. **Generator scope** (if generators exist but not documented)
5. **Level 1-3 oversight definition** (if assumption is questioned)
