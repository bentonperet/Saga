SCHEDULE FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS - 6 WEEK TARGET,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phase,Industry Standard Duration,RFP Constraint,Proposed WBS,Feasibility,Notes

Level 4 Functional Testing,8-10 weeks,Not specified,5 weeks,AGGRESSIVE,"Compressed from typical 8-10 weeks to 5 weeks. Requires efficient execution and 10-person site crew."
Level 5 IST,2-3 weeks,Not specified,1 week,AGGRESSIVE,"Compressed from typical 2-3 weeks to 1 week. Requires load banks ready and no major deficiencies from L4."
Combined L4+L5,10-13 weeks typical,"6 weeks max per RFP",6 weeks,FEASIBLE,"Achieves RFP 6-week constraint with 10-person site crew and strong management coordination. Minimal schedule contingency."

Risk Assessment:,,,,,,,,,,,,
,- 6-week duration is feasible but aggressive compared to industry standards (54% schedule compression),,,,,,,,,,,,
,- Requires: No major equipment deficiencies from L4, load banks ready and operational, strong vendor support, good weather (minimal outdoor delays), efficient crew with no downtime,,,,,,,,,,,,
,- Contingency: If issues arise, 6.5-7 weeks more realistic. Build flexibility into contract terms per pricing assumptions.,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,

CRITICAL PATH ACTIVITIES - L4-L5,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activity,Duration,Dependencies,Critical Path?,Schedule Risk

Outdoor Electrical (Transformers, RMUs, MV SWBDs),2 weeks,L3 complete + equipment energized,YES,HIGH - Weather dependent outdoor testing
Outdoor Mechanical (Chillers 27 units),3 weeks,"L3 complete, piping systems pressure tested/flushed/filled",YES,HIGH - Large chiller quantity drives schedule
Indoor Electrical (UPS 113 units),3 weeks,Outdoor electrical complete + power available,YES,HIGH - High UPS quantity (113 units) is schedule driver
Indoor Mechanical (CDUs + CRAH),3 weeks,"Outdoor mechanical complete, chilled water available",YES,MEDIUM - Dependent on chiller commissioning completion
White Space Power Distribution (160 RPPs),2 weeks,Indoor electrical complete,MEDIUM,MEDIUM - High quantity but straightforward testing
System-Level Testing,1 week,All equipment functional testing complete,YES,MEDIUM - Cannot start until all equipment passes L4
L5 IST with Load Banks,1 week,"All L4 complete, load banks available and operational",YES,CRITICAL - Load bank availability and readiness

Overall Critical Path: Outdoor Elec (2w) → Indoor Elec (3w overlaps with Outdoor Mech) → System Testing (1w) → L5 IST (1w) = 6 weeks minimum,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,

EQUIPMENT TESTING SEQUENCE & PARALLELIZATION,,,,,,,,,,,,

Week,Electrical Activities,Mechanical Activities,Parallel Activities Explanation

1,"Transformers (44 units), RMUs (23 units), MV SWBDs (2)",Chillers startup (27 units),"Electrical and mechanical teams work in parallel on different systems. Both can proceed simultaneously."
2,"Complete outdoor electrical, LV switchboards startup (44 units)","Chillers continued (27 units), Buffer tanks (27), Chilled water system","Continued parallel execution. Electrical moves indoors while mechanical completes outdoor equipment."
3,"UPS functional testing (113 units), Battery testing startup (351 sampling)","CRAH elec rooms (11 units), CDU startup (32 units)","UPS testing is most labor-intensive electrical activity. Mechanical starts indoor equipment commissioning."
4,"Complete UPS and batteries, Rack power panels startup (160 units)","CDU continued (32 units), CRAH data halls (36 units), Hot aisle containment (11)","High equipment quantities in both disciplines require full crews. Some cross-discipline support for containment."
5,"Complete rack power panels (160), RDPs (7 units), Electrical system-level testing","Complete CRAH and CDUs, Mechanical system-level testing, Heat load test prep","Disciplines converge for system-level testing. Teams coordinate for integrated testing preparation."
6,Electrical system integration (L5),Mechanical system integration (L5),"Fully integrated testing: both disciplines work together on load testing, monitoring, emergency scenarios"

Key Parallelization Strategy: Electrical and mechanical teams work independently on their systems Weeks 1-4, converge for system testing Week 5, fully integrate for L5 testing Week 6.,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,

VENDOR COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS,,,,,,,,,,,,

Equipment Type,Vendor Support Required,Timing,Coordination Lead,Notes

Transformers (44 units),Startup assistance and warranty activation,Weeks 1-2,Elec Lead,"Pre-schedule vendor 4-6 weeks before L4 start"
UPS (113 units),Factory startup technician for initial units,Week 3,Elec Lead,"Vendor must witness first few units, then CxA can proceed independently"
Chillers (27 units),Startup technician for each unit,Weeks 1-3,Mech Lead,"Chiller startup is vendor-required for warranty. Long lead time due to quantity."
CDUs (32 units),Startup assistance,Weeks 3-4,Mech Lead,Vertiv CDU startup support
CRAH Fan Walls (47 units),Startup assistance and TAB support,Weeks 3-5,Mech Lead,"Vertiv startup support. TAB performed by others, CxA oversight."
Load Banks,Setup and operation (by others),Week 6,Cx Manager,"PGCIS reviews load bank plan and oversees operation, but does not provide/operate per scope assumptions"
Monitoring Systems (BMS/EPMS/DCIM),Integration support,Weeks 5-6,Cx Manager,Controls contractor or OEM support for system integration
CxAlloy or Facility Grid Platform,Platform support and training,Weeks 1-6,Doc Coordinator,Commissioning management platform per RFI-001.02

Critical Vendor Coordination: Chiller vendor startup (27 units) is critical path item. Must pre-schedule and confirm availability.,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,

ASSUMPTIONS & NOTES - L4-L5 EXECUTION,,,,,,,,,,,,

,1. 6-week duration based on RFP constraint "Level 4 – IST Duration: No more than six (6) weeks per 36 MW block",,,,,,,,,,,,
,2. Assumes 6-week constraint applies to combined L4+L5 per RFI-001.01 (critical question requiring clarification),,,,,,,,,,,,
,3. L4 duration: 5 weeks (Functional Performance Testing + Heat Load Testing + System Level Testing),,,,,,,,,,,,
,4. L5 duration: 1 week (Integrated Systems Testing) - aggressive but achievable if L4 goes smoothly,,,,,,,,,,,,
,5. 10-person site crew working 50 hours/week provides adequate capacity for 6-week timeline,,,,,,,,,,,,
,6. Equipment has been properly energized and L3 pre-functional testing substantially complete before L4 start,,,,,,,,,,,,
,7. Mechanical systems dominate schedule due to high equipment count and sequential dependencies (chillers → CDUs → CRAH),,,,,,,,,,,,
,8. Pressure testing, flush & fill, and TAB performed by others; PGCIS oversight only per scope assumptions,,,,,,,,,,,,
,9. Load banks provided and operated by others; PGCIS load bank plan review and oversight only per scope assumptions,,,,,,,,,,,,
,10. Weather contingency NOT explicitly included - assume indoor work can proceed during outdoor weather delays,,,,,,,,,,,,
,11. Vendor support pre-coordinated 4-6 weeks before L4 start to avoid delays,,,,,,,,,,,,
,12. Commissioning management platform (CxAlloy or Facility Grid) used per RFI-001.02 for test data and documentation,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,

RISKS - L4-L5 EXECUTION PHASE,,,,,,,,,,,,

Risk,Probability,Impact,Consequence,Mitigation

6-Week Schedule Constraint Infeasible,MEDIUM,CRITICAL,"Cannot complete L4+L5 in 6 weeks if RFP constraint interpreted strictly","RFI-001.01 CRITICAL question - must clarify scope of 6-week constraint before finalizing schedule"
Equipment Deficiencies from L3,HIGH,HIGH,"Retest time extends L4 schedule, may exceed 6-week window","15% contingency typically required. Include contractual language about L3 substantial completion requirements."
Vendor Support Delays,MEDIUM,MEDIUM,"Cannot complete equipment startup without vendor, particularly chillers (27 units)","Pre-schedule vendors 4-6 weeks in advance, have vendor SOWs signed before L4 start"
Load Bank Unavailability,LOW,CRITICAL,"Cannot complete L5 IST load testing without load banks","Contractually require load banks from Owner/others per scope assumptions, confirm availability 6 weeks before L5"
Chiller Commissioning Delays,MEDIUM,HIGH,"Chiller testing is critical path and weather-dependent. 27 units require significant time.","Start chiller commissioning early (Week 1), have backup indoor activities if weather delays outdoor work"
UPS Quantity (113 units),MEDIUM,HIGH,"Testing 113 UPS units in 3 weeks is aggressive (2.6 units/day)","Efficient test procedures, vendor support for initial units, potential for parallel testing with full crew"
Weather Delays (Outdoor Equipment),MEDIUM,MEDIUM,"Outdoor transformer and chiller testing weather-dependent","Plan outdoor testing early in schedule (Weeks 1-2), have indoor backup tasks ready"
Monitoring System Integration Issues,MEDIUM,MEDIUM,"BMS/EPMS/DCIM integration problems delay L5 IST","Early integration testing during L4, controls contractor support, dedicated integration time in Week 6"

Overall Risk: MEDIUM-HIGH due to aggressive 6-week schedule and RFI-001.01 constraint ambiguity,,,,,,,,,,,,
