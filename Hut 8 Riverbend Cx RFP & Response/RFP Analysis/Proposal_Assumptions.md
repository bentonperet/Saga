**Project:** Riverbend Data Center Commissioning
**Client:** Hut 8
**Document Date:** 2025-11-07
**Status:** Working Draft for Proposal Development

---

## PURPOSE

This document consolidates all assumptions made during proposal development for the Hut 8 Riverbend Data Center Commissioning RFP. These assumptions will be clearly stated in the proposal to establish scope boundaries and protect against scope creep.

---

## SCOPE ASSUMPTIONS

### General Commissioning Scope

**A. QA/QC Services**
- CxA will document assumptions, scope of work, and manpower requirements for QA/QC as a separate proposal section
- QA/QC services are priced separately from base commissioning services
- Three QA/QC options will be provided:
  - **Option A:** Commissioning quality verification only ($100K-$150K)
  - **Option B:** Construction quality oversight for critical infrastructure ($300K-$500K)
  - **Option C:** Comprehensive construction inspection program ($1.0M-$2.0M)

**B. Load Bank Provision and Operation**
- Air and liquid load banks to be provided and operated by others
- PGCIS (CxA) will provide load bank plan review and oversight only
- Load bank rental/purchase costs are priced as separate optional service
- If Owner elects CxA to provide load banks, this will be separate line item

**C. Pressure Testing, Flush & Fill, and Test and Balancing (TAB)**
- Pressure testing, flush & fill, and test and balancing (TAB) of liquid/liquid and liquid/air equipment to be performed by others
- PGCIS will provide oversight and documentation review only
- TAB contractor to be engaged by GC or Owner
- CxA will review and approve TAB reports and verify results

**D. White Space Configuration**
- CxA will base all pricing and planning on **White Space Option 2** per RFP instruction
- White Space Option 2 is the most extensive configuration:
  - 65 Hot Aisle Containment Units
  - 960 Rack Power Panels (1000/1200A)
  - 40 Remote Distribution Panels (400A)
  - 190 Cooling Distribution Units (Vertiv XDU 2300)
  - 214 CRAH Fan Walls
- If other white space options are selected, unit price adjustments will apply

## SCHEDULE ASSUMPTIONS

### Level 4-5 Duration

**A. Six-Week Duration per 36 MW Block**
- CxA will assume **6 weeks total duration** per 36 MW block from start to finish
- **Level 4** (Functional Performance Testing, Heat Load Testing, System Level Testing) = **4-5 weeks**
- **Level 5** (Integrated Systems Testing) = **1-2 weeks**
- Total: 6 weeks per RFP constraint

**B. No Overlapping L4-L5 Phases**
- CxA will assume that **no two Level 4-5 commissioning phases overlap** during the project duration
- Pricing is based on sequential commissioning of six 36 MW blocks
- If overlapping L4-L5 phases are required, a change order may be necessary to provide additional resources
- Peak staffing model supports one active L4-L5 phase at a time

**C. Commissioning Continuity**
- Pricing assumes that Level 4 and Level 5 commissioning will be **contiguous** (continuous without delays)
- Any delays not related to PGCIS (commissioning agent) may require a change order
- GC readiness for Level 4 start is critical assumption
- Level 1-3 activities assumed substantially complete before Level 4 start

**D. Construction Delays and GC Readiness**
- Any construction-related delays or GC readiness issues unrelated to PGCIS may necessitate a change order
- CxA schedule assumes GC provides turnover packages on schedule
- Equipment energization and Level 3 pre-functional testing complete per schedule
- Weather delays beyond 5 cumulative days per phase may result in schedule extension
- Holiday shutdowns (if required) will extend schedule accordingly
