Actual Estimate (per WBS),,,3450,,Includes full site crew allocation and management support for 12-week duration

Note: Discrepancy between bottom-up equipment hours and WBS crew allocation hours reflects:,,,,,,,,,,
,1. Crew availability/standby time during specialist vendor testing,,,,,,,,,,
,2. Weather delays and outdoor work restrictions (Louisiana May-July),,,,,,,,,,
,3. Utility coordination delays and waiting time,,,,,,,,,,
,4. Safety requirements and work permit constraints for high voltage testing,,,,,,,,,,
,5. Parallel activities and multi-discipline coordination inefficiencies,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,

CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS & NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,

,1. 300 MW switchyard divided into 6 blocks of 50 MW each per utility distribution architecture,,,,,,,,
,2. Equipment quantities per block: 2 MV switchboards + 23 RMUs per RFP totals (12 ÷ 6 and 138 ÷ 6),,,,,,,,
,3. Main transformer quantities and utility voltage UNKNOWN - requires RFI-001.07 clarification (CRITICAL),,,,,,,,
,4. Cx Manager (1.0 FTE) shared across all 6 switchyard blocks - provides program-level oversight,,,,,,,,
,5. Documentation Coordinator (0.25 FTE) shared across 6 blocks - centralized documentation support,,,,,,,,
,6. 12-week duration per block assumes sequential or partially overlapping commissioning,,,,,,,,
,7. Weather contingency (15%) built in for Louisiana May-July outdoor high voltage testing,,,,,,,,
,8. Utility coordination and witness testing critical path items - schedule depends on utility availability,,,,,,,,
,9. High voltage testing requires specialized test equipment and certified technicians,,,,,,,,
,10. Switchyard must be fully commissioned and energized before any data hall commissioning can begin,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,

DEPENDENCIES & RISKS - SWITCHYARD 50 MW BLOCK,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dependency/Risk,Type,Impact,Mitigation,,,,

Design completion,Dependency,CRITICAL,Requires completed utility interconnection design before L1 can start,,,,
Utility approval of relay settings,Dependency,CRITICAL,Requires utility engineer review and approval before energization - long lead time,,,,
Equipment delivery and installation,Dependency,HIGH,GC must complete installation before commissioning can begin,,,,
Weather delays (outdoor HV testing),Risk,HIGH,"Louisiana May-July: hurricanes, thunderstorms, high humidity affect outdoor testing",,,,
Utility energization schedule,Risk,CRITICAL,Utility controls energization timeline - may not align with project schedule,,,,
Specialized test equipment availability,Risk,MEDIUM,High voltage test equipment (megger 500kV+) rental availability and lead time,,,,
Certified HV technicians,Risk,MEDIUM,Require utility-approved or certified technicians for high voltage work,,,,
Scope ambiguity (RFI-001.07),Risk,CRITICAL,"Main transformer scope unclear, utility voltage unknown, equipment list incomplete",,,,

Overall Risk Rating: HIGH due to critical path nature and RFI-001.07 scope ambiguity,,,,,,,,,,
