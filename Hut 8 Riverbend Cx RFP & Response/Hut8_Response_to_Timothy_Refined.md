# Hut 8 Riverbend - Response to Timothy D'Agostino Questions

---

Hello Timothy,

Thank you for the quick response. Please see our answers merged in between your questions as sub-bullets.

---

**"High velocity, "GET SH$T DONE" culture matching Hut 8's fast-paced environment" → This is a great line**

Thank you for the kind words - we were hopeful that you would feel that way.

---

**On Pages 11 & 12 you mention 4-6 weeks for L4 and 2-3 Weeks for L5 → We'll need a firm commitment that this can be done in 6 weeks otherwise we will fall behind schedule. Are you able to make that commitment?**

**Yes, with conditions:**
- 6-week completion is achievable with first-time-quality installations
- Our QA/QC program mitigates this risk by working proactively with trades to establish quality standards before installation
- Early detection/correction of construction defects in L1-L3 creates schedule contingency for L4 where it matters most

---

**Do you foresee issues getting the necessary rental equipment (i.e. Load banks/chillers/etc.)?**

**Liquid-cooled load banks:** Longest lead item currently. We have manufacturer relationships to expedite if needed.

**Recommendation:** Purchase liquid-cooled load banks rather than rent. Benefits:
- De-risks future project schedules
- Optimizes cost through repeat usage vs. rental
- Guarantees availability for aggressive timelines

**Chillers/other equipment:** Should be ordered now if not already. Extended lead times are a critical path risk. We can support procurement and OFCI coordination as needed.

---

**What do you anticipate the cost for rental equipment to be on this project? Can you help me estimate that?**

Let us reach out to get current pricing and provide detailed estimates.

---

**I recognize you all need to charge a margin of 10% if you procure the equipment. Are you open to a hybrid model where you help us find it but we'll cut the PO and provide it for you? That way you're not taking the risk?**

**Yes.** If awarded, we'll include sourcing support in our scope while you issue POs directly. This eliminates our margin and your risk.

---

**Can you expand more on the digital twin commissioning and how that works? This may warrant a call to discuss but it seems interesting.**

Traditional L4 Cx is pass/fail for basic functionality. Digital twin technology:
- **Exposes hidden issues** that pass functionally but create future operational risk
- **Accelerates troubleshooting** through real-time trend analysis and visualization
- **Improves IST outcomes** by resolving issues before integrated testing

**Goal:** Zero-defect IST handoff.

**Next step:** Technical deep-dive with our digital twin specialists to demonstrate capabilities.

---

**Will Hut 8 own the procedures and documentation that is developed for this project?**

**Yes.** Our objective is to reduce your dependency on us, not create it. You'll own all deliverables and institutional knowledge developed during this project.

---

**The equipment labeling is interesting → Would love to see pricing on this.**

We'll provide detailed pricing. Cost is relatively minor compared to the operational value.

---

**One clarification in case it changes things on your end → There will be no "final" IST testing since we will not be able to bring down previously commissioned data halls to test all of them together. Was that assumed in your proposal?**

**Assumed approach:** Independent commissioning per data hall (L1 through IST for each 36 MW block).

**Technical consideration:** Without reviewing your SLD, we cannot confirm if electrical interdependencies limit independent IST execution.

**Recommendation:** Review SLD and develop phased Cx strategy collaboratively to confirm isolation boundaries and IST scope per phase.

**Next step:** Convene technical review with your electrical team to validate Cx plan assumptions.

Best regards,
