**Re: Commissioning Services Proposal - Riverbend Hyperscale AI Data Center Development, Abilene, Texas**

---

Dear [TBD],

PACHYDERM GLOBAL Critical Infrastructure Services (PGCIS) is pleased to submit this comprehensive proposal to provide commissioning services for the Hut 8 Riverbend Hyperscale AI Data Center Development, a first-of-a-kind 216 MW IT capacity facility (300 MW utility infrastructure) representing Hut 8's flagship entry into the mission-critical hyperscale AI infrastructure market.

## Understanding Your Priorities

We recognize that Riverbend Development is more than a data center project, it is Hut 8's proof point to the hyperscale AI market, a facility that must operate flawlessly from day one to validate your capability to compete with established providers. Our proposal directly addresses your critical priorities:

**1. Speed to Market**
- **Time is revenue** - Every week of delay costs $500K-$1M in lost hyperscale client revenue
- Commercial operation dates directly tied to client contract commitments
- First-to-market advantage in competitive hyperscale AI infrastructure market
- Zero tolerance for commissioning delays that push COD dates

**2. Schedule Certainty**
- Aggressive 6-week commissioning timeline per 36 MW phase (40-60% faster than industry standard)
- Proactive risk management prevents 80% of potential delays from becoming actual schedule impact
- Advanced schedule support with Primavera P6 integration, predictive analytics, and real-time tracking
- 216 MW delivered by February 27, 2027 at 3.6 MW per week average delivery rate

**3. First-Time Quality**
- First-of-a-kind (FOAK) support for 216 MW liquid cooling infrastructure and 34.5kV switchyard integration
- Specialized expertise in Vertiv OFC chillers and XDU 2300 CDU systems
- Proactive Quality in Action approach, preventing issues during installation, not discovering them during testing
- 95%+ first-pass functional test rates vs. 60-75% industry average

**4. Cost Predictability**
- Transparent hourly rates by resource category (no hidden markups)
- Two flexible service delivery options to match your needs and budget
- Bi-weekly invoicing with real-time cost tracking, earned value management, and forecasting
- Transparent pricing for scope changes, immediate, transparent adjustments

## Two Service Delivery Options

**OPTION 1: Full Turnkey Commissioning (Primary CxA)**
- PGCIS performs all L2-L5 commissioning activities with complete accountability
- Single point of responsibility for commissioning quality and schedule
- Maximum quality assurance with comprehensive FOAK support
- Ideal for: Owners who want turnkey solution with highest quality certainty

**OPTION 2: Owner's Agent - Planning, Program Management, QA/QC, and Documentation Support**
- Advisory design review and commissioning plan development
- Advanced schedule support with program management and coordination
- Proactive & collaborative Quality in Action QA/QC oversight
- CxA oversight and validation throughout L2-L5 (performed by others)
- Optional Digital Twin Technology with Machine Learning to accelerate schedule and validate component level performance
- Ideal for: Owners with capable GC or separate CxA for L4-L5 execution, seeking independent oversight

Both options include comprehensive FOAK support for Riverbend's unique design elements, ensuring your first hyperscale AI facility achieves operational excellence regardless of which path you choose.

## Why PACHYDERM GLOBAL for the Hut 8's Riverbend Development

**Specialized Expertise:**
- Deep experience commissioning liquid-cooled hyperscale AI data centers
- Medium-voltage (MV) switchyard expertise: MV ring bus architectures, Ring Main Units (RMUs), automated SCADA switching procedures, and utility coordination
- First-of-a-kind deployments requiring proactive risk management
- Owner's Agent experience, we're the firm hyperscalers hire to oversee their primary commissioning contractors

**Technology-Enabled Excellence:**
- Proprietary commissioning platform with real-time dashboards and predictive analytics
- Primavera P6 integration with advanced schedule optimization
- **Digital Twin Technology with Machine Learning** for L4-L5 acceleration: Virtual commissioning environment validates control sequences and integrated system behavior before physical testing, reducing field rework by 60-80% and accelerating L4-L5 completion (Option 1 included, optional for Option 2)
- 24/7 stakeholder visibility into program status and risk scoring

**Proactive Partnership:**
- High velocity, "GET SH$T DONE" culture matching Hut 8's fast-paced environment
- Data-driven decision making with quantified risk assessments
- Early intervention prevents issues 2-3 weeks before they become visible
- Direct access to program leadership, no bureaucracy or committee decisions

## Key Differentiators

**First-of-a-Kind (FOAK) Support:**
Riverbend represents Hut 8's first 216 MW liquid-cooled AI data center with unique design elements. We provide specialized FOAK support for L2-L3 activities including:
- Custom test and startup procedures tailored to Riverbend's design (not generic templates)
- Liquid cooling protocols for Vertiv XDU 2300 CDU installations
- High-density electrical protocols for 480V distribution serving high-capacity transformers
- 34.5kV switchyard protocols: MV ring bus architecture commissioning, Ring Main Unit (RMU) testing, automated SCADA switching procedure validation, protective relaying, and utility interconnection
- Pre-commissioning coordination workshops and lessons learned integration

**Proactive Risk Identification:**
- CRAH Fan Wall advisory: Specified Vertiv CA606 model may be European version with US compliance/availability concerns, we'll flag this during L1 review
- No generators specified: We understand utility redundancy is the backup strategy and can assist with load shedding procedure development
- Equipment compliance review during factory test documentation review prevents costly field modifications

**Proven Track Record:**
- Zero critical path delays attributable to commissioning in recent hyperscale projects
- 95%+ first-time functional test pass rates through proactive QA/QC
- 60-80% reduction in field rework through digital twin virtual commissioning

**On-Site Equipment Labeling Service (Optional):**
- Professional Traffolyte label engraver brought to site for on-demand label generation
- Dramatically accelerates resolution of labeling problems and errors (common source of commissioning delays)
- Avoids lengthy and potentially incorrect bulk label orders
- Labels provided directly to trades for immediate installation
- Schedule acceleration through real-time labeling corrections
