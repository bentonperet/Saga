## Critical Success Factors

### L2-L3 Quality Strategy (Phase 0)
During Phase 0, PGCIS deploys **4-person mechanical team** (Lead MCx-A, Lead MCx-B, MCx Tech-A, MCx Tech-B) to Phases 1-6 L2-L3 activities. This enhanced mechanical coverage ensures:
- 100% equipment pre-startup inspections
- Comprehensive startup oversight with vendors
- First-time installation quality
- Protection of 6-week L4-L5 schedule window

### L4-L5 Rotation Strategy
Alternating lead responsibility between Team A and Team B provides:
- Fresh perspective for each phase
- Peer review and quality assurance
- Reduced risk of oversight fatigue
- Knowledge sharing across teams

### Document Controller Rotation
Doc Control A and Doc Control B alternate weeks to provide:
- 100% continuous on-site documentation support
- Work-life balance for documentation team
- Seamless handover and continuity
- Complete coverage across all phases

### Contingency Resources
- **Redundant ECx:** Available for surge support during critical testing periods
- **Redundant MCx:** Available for surge support during mechanical startup overlaps
- **SME-Electrical:** Remote/on-site for specialized electrical systems support
- **SME-D2C:** Remote/on-site for Design-to-Construction technical support
- **Cx Manager Backup:** Lead ECx-A or Lead MCx-A can step into Cx Manager role if needed

## Notes on Schedule Compliance

1. **Sunday-Based Calendar:** All weeks begin on Sunday to align with construction industry standard weekly reporting cycles.

2. **Phase 0 Negative Numbering:** Using negative week numbers (-14 to -1) clearly delineates Phase 0 from Phases 1-6 and maintains continuity with the August 2026 Week 1 reference point.

3. **6-Week L4-L5 Window:** Each phase has exactly 6 weeks for L4-L5 completion. This tight timeline requires exceptional L2-L3 quality to prevent delays.

4. **Team Mobility:** Lead MCx-A and MCx Tech-A transition from Team B back to Team A after Week 6 (Phase 1 completion) to support Team A's first L4-L5 rotation lead for Phase 2.

5. **Continuous L2-L3 Coverage:** While leads rotate for L4-L5, technicians maintain continuous L2-L3 coverage for upcoming phases, ensuring no gaps in quality oversight.

6. **Performance Tracking:** Lashica Woodard's Issue Tracking and Performance Analytics capabilities provide real-time visibility into program health, enabling proactive schedule risk management.
