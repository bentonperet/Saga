## PURPOSE

This document consolidates all assumptions and exclusions for the PACHYDERM GLOBAL Critical Infrastructure Services (PGCIS) proposal for Hut 8 Riverbend Hyperscale AI Data Center Development commissioning services. These assumptions establish clear scope boundaries, protect against scope creep, and ensure alignment between PGCIS and Hut 8 on project expectations.

## SCOPE ASSUMPTIONS

### General Commissioning Scope

**A. Two Service Delivery Options**
- **Option 1: Full Turnkey Commissioning (Primary CxA)** - PGCIS performs all L1-L5 commissioning activities with complete accountability
- **Option 2: Owner's Agent - Planning, Program Management, QA/QC, and Documentation Support** - PGCIS provides advisory design review, commissioning plan development, advanced schedule support, proactive QA/QC oversight, CxA oversight and validation throughout L2-L5 performed by others
- L4-L5 commissioning performed by others (GC's team, vendor teams, or separate commissioning firm) with PGCIS oversight in Option 2

**B. Load Bank Provision and Operation**
- **Option 1:** Load banks may be provided and operated by PGCIS (priced as separate optional service: $50K-$150K for 42-week rental)
- **Option 2:** Load banks to be provided and operated by others
- PGCIS will provide load bank plan review and oversight
- Load bank rental/purchase costs are priced as separate optional service if PGCIS provides

**C. Pressure Testing, Flush & Fill, and Test and Balancing (TAB)**
- Pressure testing, flush & fill, and test and balancing (TAB) of liquid cooling and mechanical equipment to be performed by others
- PGCIS will provide oversight and documentation review
- TAB contractor to be engaged by GC or Owner
- PGCIS will review and approve TAB reports and verify results

**D. White Space Configuration**
- PGCIS will base all pricing and planning on **White Space Option 2** (BASE configuration) per RFP
- White Space Option 2 configuration per phase:
  - 10 Hot Aisle Containment Units (Vertiv SmartRun)
  - 160 Rack Power Panels (1000/1200A, Vertiv)
  - 7 Remote Distribution Panels (400A RXV Panels, Vertiv)
  - 32 Cooling Distribution Units (Vertiv XDU 2300)

## SCHEDULE ASSUMPTIONS

### Commissioning Timeline

**A. Six-Week Duration per 36 MW Phase**
- PGCIS assumes **6 weeks total duration** per 36 MW phase for L4-L5 commissioning
- **Level 4** (Functional Performance Testing, Heat Load Testing, System Level Testing) = **4 weeks**
- **Level 5** (Integrated Systems Testing) = **2 weeks**
- Total: 6 weeks per phase (40-60% faster than industry standard 8-12 weeks)

**B. No Overlapping L4-L5 Phases**
- PGCIS assumes that **no two Level 4-5 commissioning phases overlap** during the project duration
- Pricing is based on sequential commissioning of six 36 MW phases
- If overlapping L4-L5 phases are required, a change order will be necessary to provide additional resources
- Peak staffing model supports one active L4-L5 phase at a time

**C. Commissioning Continuity**
- Pricing assumes that Level 4 and Level 5 commissioning will be **contiguous** (continuous without delays)
- Any delays not attributable to PGCIS may require a change order for demobilization/remobilization or extended resource deployment
- GC readiness for Level 4 start is critical assumption
- Level 1-3 activities assumed substantially complete before Level 4 start

**D. Construction Delays and GC Readiness**
- Any construction-related delays or GC readiness issues unrelated to PGCIS may necessitate a change order
- PGCIS schedule assumes GC provides turnover packages on schedule
- Equipment energization and Level 3 pre-functional testing complete per schedule
- Weather delays beyond **5 cumulative days per phase** may result in schedule extension
- Holiday shutdowns will extend schedule accordingly (Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year)

**E. Program Duration**
- Total program duration: **63 weeks** (3 weeks planning + 60 weeks construction/commissioning)
- Planning phase: Weeks -2 through Week 0 (3 weeks)
- Construction start: Week 1 (January 5, 2026)
- Final phase completion: Week 60 (February 27, 2027)
- 216 MW delivered at **3.6 MW per week average delivery rate**
