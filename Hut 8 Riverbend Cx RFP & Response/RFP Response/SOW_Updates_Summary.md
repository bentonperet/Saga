### 9. First-of-a-Kind (FOAK) Support for L2-L3 Activities
✅ **Section 3.2 (L2)** - Added comprehensive "First-of-a-Kind Support" section:
- **For Both Options:** Custom test procedure development, liquid cooling L2 protocols, high-density electrical protocols, 34.5kV switchyard protocols, coordination workshops, lessons learned integration
- **Option 1 Specific:** PGCIS executes all FOAK L2 with specialized expertise, real-time issue resolution
- **Option 2 Specific:** PGCIS provides comprehensive procedures to GC, proactive QA/QC oversight, weekly FOAK issue tracking, escalation protocol

✅ **Section 3.3 (L3)** - Added comprehensive "First-of-a-Kind Support" section:
- **For Both Options:** Custom startup procedures, liquid cooling system startup protocols, utility coordination support, multi-system energization sequencing, FOAK risk mitigation planning, vendor coordination
