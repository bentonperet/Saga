**Potential Concern:** The CA606 model specified in the RFP may be a European model that could face availability challenges or US standards compliance issues (UL listing, NEC compliance, voltage/frequency compatibility).

**PGCIS Advisory Role:**
- Review factory test reports and certifications for US compliance (UL, ETL, or equivalent)
- Verify voltage/frequency compatibility (480V 3-phase 60Hz)
- Assess lead times and delivery schedules for potential procurement risks
- Provide recommendations for alternative models or design modifications if compliance/availability issues are identified
- Coordinate with design team and Vertiv to resolve any discrepancies early in the procurement phase

**Proactive Risk Mitigation:** Identifying equipment compliance or availability issues during L1 review prevents costly delays and field modifications during construction and commissioning phases.

- **On-Site Equipment Labeling Service (Traffolyte Engraver):** PGCIS brings professional Traffolyte label engraver to site to generate accurate equipment labels on-demand as needed, dramatically accelerating resolution of labeling problems and errors, avoiding lengthy and potentially incorrect bulk orders, providing labels directly to trades for immediate installation (priced commensurate with value, convenience, and schedule acceleration potential)
- **Load Shedding Procedure Development:** Develop and validate load shedding procedures for utility-wide outage scenarios (coordination with Hut 8 operations team)
- **Emergency Response Planning:** Enhanced emergency response procedures beyond standard commissioning scope
- Extended L2-L3 construction quality oversight beyond moderate oversight baseline
- Load bank procurement and rental (if not provided by GC or Owner)
- Post-commissioning support and warranty period services
- Operational readiness training and support beyond standard handover
