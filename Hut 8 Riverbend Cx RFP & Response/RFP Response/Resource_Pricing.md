PGCIS provides transparent, straightforward pricing based on actual resources deployed and hours worked. Our pricing structure includes:

- **Hourly labor rates** by resource category (published below)
- **Weekly travel costs** per deployed resource
- **Time & Materials (T&M)** approach with program-level visibility
- **No hidden fees** - what you see is what you pay

**This document provides hourly rates for resource categories. Actual program costs will vary based on Option selected (Option 1 vs. Option 2), final schedule duration, and scope adjustments.**

### 6.1 Program Cost Visibility

PGCIS provides complete transparency into program costs:

**Real-Time Cost Tracking:**
- Live dashboard shows cumulative labor hours and costs by team
- Forecasted cost-to-complete based on schedule progress
- Variance analysis (actual vs. baseline estimate)

- Invoice reconciliation and payment status

---

### 6.2 Change Order Management

**Scope Changes:**
Changes to the baseline scope may result in cost adjustments, including:

- Equipment quantity changes >10% from baseline
- Additional phases or buildings beyond six 36 MW data halls
- Overlapping L4-L5 phases requiring additional resources
- Extended schedule duration due to construction delays (not attributable to PGCIS)
- Scope additions (e.g., factory witness testing, extended QA/QC, post-commissioning support)

**Change Order Process:**
1. Scope change identified by PGCIS or Hut 8
2. Impact assessment provided within 48 hours (labor hours, cost, schedule impact)
3. Formal change order proposal with unit pricing applied
4. Hut 8 approval required before work proceeds
5. Change order incorporated into baseline and tracked separately

**Unit Pricing Schedule:**
All change orders priced using published hourly rates and travel costs (no markup or premium pricing)

---

## 7. RESOURCE DEPLOYMENT COMPARISON: OPTION 1 VS. OPTION 2

### 7.1 Resource Deployment Differences

| Resource Element | Option 1: Full Turnkey | Option 2: Owner's Agent |
|--------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Grey Team** | Full duration (63 weeks) | Full duration (63 weeks) |
| **Green Team** | Planning phase (3 weeks) | Planning phase (3 weeks) |
| **Blue/Yellow Teams** | L2-L5 execution (58 weeks) | L2-L3 oversight only (30 weeks) |
| **Test Equipment** | Full commissioning equipment | Minimal (oversight role) |
| **Load Banks** | PGCIS provides (optional) | Provided by others |

**Value Proposition:**

**Option 1:** Maximum quality, single point of accountability, PGCIS performs all commissioning work
- Best for: Owners who want turnkey solution with highest quality assurance
- Risk mitigation: PGCIS fully accountable for commissioning schedule and quality

**Option 2:** Independent oversight with reduced resource deployment
- Best for: Owners with capable GC or separate commissioning firm for L4-L5 execution
- Risk mitigation: PGCIS provides independent oversight, schedule management, and quality validation
- Resource deployment: Reduced field team commitment while maintaining program management and QA/QC oversight

## 9. COST OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES

### 9.1 Value Engineering Opportunities

PGCIS can work with Hut 8 to optimize program costs through:

**Resource Optimization:**
- Hybrid remote/site deployment for management roles (reduce travel costs)
- Flexible staffing during low-activity periods
- Cross-training resources to handle multiple roles

**Schedule Optimization:**
- Compressed testing schedules where feasible (without compromising quality)
- Parallel testing activities to reduce duration
- Strategic use of vendor resources for OEM-specific activities

**Equipment Optimization:**
- Rental vs. purchase analysis for load banks
- Shared test equipment across phases
- Coordination with GC to leverage existing site equipment

**Estimated Cost Savings:** 10-15% through proactive value engineering (without reducing scope or quality)

---

### 9.2 Risk-Based Cost Management

**Low-Risk Elements (Potential for Fixed Pricing):**
- Grey Team labor (predictable weekly hours throughout program)
- Green Team SME advisory (fixed 6-week engagement)
- Travel costs (negotiate fixed weekly rates after mobilization)

**Variable Elements (T&M Approach Required):**
- Blue/Yellow Team labor (dependent on actual testing duration and first-pass rates)
- Schedule extensions due to construction delays
- Scope changes and equipment quantity adjustments

**Hybrid Pricing Model:**
PGCIS can offer a hybrid approach:
- Fixed price for Grey/Green Teams (predictable costs)
- T&M with NTE for Blue/Yellow Teams (protects both parties)
- Unit pricing for scope changes (transparent and immediate)
