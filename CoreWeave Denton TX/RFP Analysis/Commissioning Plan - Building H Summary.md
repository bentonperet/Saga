## Load Bank Requirements

### Generator Load Bank Testing (18 Generators × 1.25 MW)
- **Minimum Load Bank Capacity Required:** 2.5 MW (for parallel testing)
- **Testing Scenarios:**
  - Individual generator: 1.25 MW load bank
  - Parallel operation: Up to 2.5 MW load bank
  - Load transfer testing: Coordinated load bank scenarios

### UPS Load Bank Testing
- **1250 KVA UPS Testing:** Requires 1.25 MVA load bank per unit
- **250 KVA UPS Testing:** Requires 250 KVA load bank per unit
- **STS Testing:** Requires coordinated load bank testing

**Recommended Load Bank Package:**
- 2x 2.5 MW resistive load banks (for generator testing)
- 2x 1.5 MVA load banks (for UPS testing)
- Mobile/trailer-mounted for flexibility
