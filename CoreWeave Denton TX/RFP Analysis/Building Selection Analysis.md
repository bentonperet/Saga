## Detailed Analysis: Your Top 3 Candidates

### Building B - Customer Handoff: 5/3/26

**PROS:**
- **Latest timeline** = Most preparation time before commissioning starts (87 days of owner activities)
- **Mature project phase** = Contractor will have worked through issues on earlier buildings
- **Reference opportunity** = Can observe Cx on buildings C, D, F, G, H beforehand
- **Long commissioning window** = 87 days allows for thorough work and schedule flexibility
- **Equipment yard work completed early** = East yard ready 2/5/26, reduces late conflicts

**CONS:**
- **Most delayed building** = High risk of further schedule slips
- **Longest construction duration** = 210.5 days (most complex)
- **Late project pressure** = Will be critical path to campus completion
- **Contractor fatigue** = Crews may be exhausted/depleted by this phase
- **Most dependencies** = Relies on courtyard work shared with C (potential delays)
- **Latest L4 commissioning ready date** = 3/20/26, very compressed timeline to 5/3 handoff
- **Complex coordination** = Shares courtyard and crane operations with Building C

**Commissioning Scope:**

## Key Differentiators

### Why NOT Building B:
1. **Highest schedule slip risk** - Latest building with most dependencies
2. **Courtyard sharing with C** - Complex crane operations through 1/26/26
3. **Latest L4 ready date** (3/20/26) with earliest customer handoff creates pressure
4. **210-day construction** is longest, most likely to slip

### Why NOT Building H:
1. **Most compressed Cx timeline** - Only 24 days from DATA hall energized to handoff
2. **Latest construction start** (7/21/25) = less float in overall schedule
3. **DATA hall not energized until 3/6/26** - Extremely tight for thorough commissioning
4. **Long flush/fill duration** (15 days) indicates complexity/risk
5. **Weather-dependent exterior** work through December 2025

### Why Building C:
1. **Balanced timeline** - Not too early, not too late (3/22/26 handoff)
2. **Most efficient Cx** - Only 17 days (vs 19 for B and H)
3. **Best L4-to-handoff buffer** - 39 days allows proper testing without rush
4. **Cleaner dependencies** - D-C courtyard work mostly done before C Cx starts
5. **Proven approach ready** - Contractor will have completed 3 buildings (G, F, D) first
6. **Clear milestones** - Well-defined ready dates with adequate float
7. **Adequate prep time** - 82.5 days owner activities is substantial
8. **Moderate complexity** - 170-day construction avoids extremes

## Risk Assessment

### Building B Risks:
- **CRITICAL**: Courtyard equipment setting 12/30/25 - 1/26/26 conflicts with early Cx prep
- **HIGH**: Latest building most likely to slip beyond 5/3/26
- **HIGH**: Final connections to E.SKID not until 2/27/26 (65 days before handoff)
- **MEDIUM**: Shared B-C courtyard creates coordination complexity

### Building C Risks:
- **MEDIUM**: Chiller piping on C Mezz (1/9/26 - 1/31/26) is critical path
- **MEDIUM**: Some D-C courtyard sharing, but mostly resolved before Cx
- **LOW**: Mid-pack position means moderate lessons learned but moderate pressure

### Building H Risks:
- **CRITICAL**: DATA hall not energized until 3/6/26 (only 54 days to handoff)
- **CRITICAL**: 15-day flush/fill is longest of all buildings (2/14 - 3/3)
- **HIGH**: Air-Water T/B finishes 3/17/26, same day as interior L4 ready milestone
- **HIGH**: Compressed 90-day interior timeline (11/24/25 - 3/17/26)
- **MEDIUM**: Latest construction start reduces schedule float

---

## Financial Considerations

### Building C Advantages:
1. **Mobilization timing** - Mid-March 2026 handoff allows ~4 months prep from RFP award
2. **Resource efficiency** - 17-day Cx is leanest scope (lower labor cost)
3. **Schedule certainty** - Medium risk = more accurate pricing
4. **Single building focus** - Can deploy full team without splitting resources

### Risk Pricing Impact:
- **Building B**: Would require higher contingency due to schedule slip risk
- **Building H**: Would require higher contingency due to compressed Cx timeline
- **Building C**: Moderate contingency appropriate for mid-pack risk profile

---

## Strategic Recommendation

### Primary Recommendation: **Building C**

**Rationale:**
1. **Optimal risk/reward balance** - Not too early (unproven) or late (schedule risk)
2. **Proven construction approach** - Contractor demonstrates capability on 3 prior buildings
3. **Adequate Cx timeline** - 39 days from L4 ready to handoff allows thorough work
4. **Manageable dependencies** - D-C courtyard mostly resolved before Cx phase
5. **Efficient scope** - 17-day Cx duration is leanest, most cost-competitive
6. **Clear milestones** - Well-defined ready dates (2/5, 2/10, 2/11/26)
7. **Mid-timeline position** - March 22 handoff provides lessons learned without late-project pressure

### Backup Option: **Building B** (if C unavailable)

**Conditions for selecting B:**
- Only if additional schedule float is added to 5/3/26 handoff
- If courtyard coordination can be better defined/separated
- If pricing can accommodate higher contingency for schedule risk
- If we can secure early access to observe Buildings C, D Cx activities

### Do NOT Recommend: **Building H**

**Reasons:**
- 24-day buffer from DATA hall energized to handoff is insufficient
- Compressed interior timeline (90 days) has high slip probability
- Latest construction start reduces overall project float
- 15-day flush/fill (longest) indicates system complexity/risk
- Weather-dependent exterior work through December adds risk

---

## Next Steps

1. **Confirm Building C availability** in RFP scope/client preferences
2. **Request additional schedule detail** for Building C critical path items
3. **Identify key personnel** who will have completed Buildings G, F, D Cx
4. **Develop detailed Cx plan** for Building C 17-day scope
5. **Price Building C** with appropriate contingency for medium risk profile
6. **Prepare Building B backup** pricing if C is unavailable/undesirable

---

## Questions for Client

1. Is there a preference/requirement to bid on specific building(s)?
2. Can we observe/shadow Cx activities on earlier buildings (G, F, D)?
3. What is the expected Cx scope (IST, FPT, documentation depth)?
4. Are there owner-provided Cx procedures or shall we develop?
5. What is the schedule contingency/float in the customer handoff dates?
6. Are there penalties for missing handoff dates?
7. Is there an option to bid multiple buildings if we demonstrate capability on one?

---

## Conclusion

**Building C is the strategically optimal choice** for a single-building commissioning bid:

- **Timeline**: March 22, 2026 handoff provides ideal balance
- **Risk**: Medium risk profile allows competitive pricing
- **Scope**: 17-day Cx is efficient and manageable
- **Dependencies**: Minimal conflicts with other buildings
- **Preparation**: 82.5 days owner activities + lessons from 3 prior buildings
- **Buffer**: 39 days from L4 ready to handoff enables thorough commissioning

Building C positions PGCIS for success while minimizing schedule, coordination, and technical risks inherent in Buildings B and H.
