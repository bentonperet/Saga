- **Bldg H Cx Level 4:** March 18 - April 6, 2026 (14 days)
- **Bldg H Cx Level 5:** April 7-13, 2026 (5 days)

**Key Observation:** The schedule allocates only **19 days total** for L4-L5 commissioning before customer handoff on April 30, 2026.

---

## Critical Timeline Gaps & Issues

### Issue #1: Commissioning Duration Assumptions

**Original Plan Assumption:**
- 30-week generic commissioning timeline
- Phased approach across multiple weeks

**Actual Schedule Reality:**
- **Total commissioning window: 19 days** (Mar 18 - Apr 13)
- **L4 Commissioning: 14 days** (Mar 18 - Apr 6)
- **L5 Commissioning: 5 days** (Apr 7-13)
- **Customer activities begin: Apr 7** (GB200 racks)

**Gap Analysis:**
The original plan's 30-week timeline was a **placeholder** and does NOT reflect the actual compressed schedule. Building H commissioning must be completed in approximately **3-4 weeks**, not 30 weeks.

---

### Issue #2: Pre-Commissioning Completion Dates

**From Schedule - Prerequisites for Commissioning:**

| System | Ready Date | Commissioning Start | Gap |
|--------|------------|---------------------|-----|
| Exterior electrical skids | Feb 24, 2026 | Mar 18, 2026 | 22 days |
| Interior STS systems | Feb 28, 2026 | Mar 18, 2026 | 18 days |
| Data Hall energization | Mar 6, 2026 | Mar 18, 2026 | 12 days |
| Data Hall ready for L4 | Mar 17, 2026 | Mar 18, 2026 | **1 day** |

**Critical Finding:** The schedule shows **only 1 day** between "H Interior Ready for L4" (Mar 17) and the start of "Bldg H Cx Level 4" (Mar 18). This provides virtually **no float** for construction delays or punch list work.

---

### Issue #3: Overlap with Customer Activities

**Problematic Overlap:**

| Activity | Date Range | Responsible Party | Issue |
|----------|------------|-------------------|-------|
| Bldg H Cx Level 5 | Apr 7-13, 2026 | Commissioning Authority | Ongoing Cx |
| GB200 Racks into DH | Apr 7, 2026 | Customer/Owner | **Conflict** |
| CDU Commissioning | Apr 8-10, 2026 | Customer/Owner | **Conflict** |
| Network Provisioning | Apr 8-21, 2026 | Customer/Owner | **Conflict** |

**Critical Issue:** L5 commissioning (Apr 7-13) **overlaps** with customer activities beginning Apr 7. This suggests either:
1. L5 commissioning must be completed by Apr 6, OR
2. L5 commissioning occurs concurrently with customer rack installation (risky)

---

### Issue #4: Missing Generator Testing Timeline

**From Electrical Drawings:**
- Building H does **NOT** have generators per the one-line diagrams reviewed
- Buildings MB-01H, MB-02H, MB-03H have generators (2 × 1250kW)
- Buildings PB-01H through PB-06H have generators (2 × 1250kW)

**Schedule Implication:**
- Building H commissioning is simpler (no generator testing required)
- However, the schedule must account for dependencies on generator-backed mechanical systems if Building H cooling depends on mechanical blocks with generators

---

## Critical Risks & Mitigation Strategies

### Risk #1: Extremely Compressed L4 Testing (14 days)

**Risk Level:** HIGH

**Impact:** Insufficient time to complete comprehensive functional testing per NETA/IEEE standards

**Mitigation:**
1. **Parallel testing approach:**
   - Run multiple test teams simultaneously
   - Test different systems concurrently (UPS, chillers, electrical distribution)

2. **Pre-commissioning verification:**
   - Complete all installation verification during construction (Nov-Feb)
   - Perform as much pre-functional testing as possible before Mar 18
   - Eliminate "discovery" issues through early inspections

3. **Extended startup phase:**
   - Treat Feb-Mar startup period as "L2/L3 hybrid"
   - Perform functional tests during startup where possible
   - Document startup activities as commissioning pre-work

4. **Streamlined test procedures:**
   - Pre-approved test procedures ready before Mar 18
   - Test equipment staged and calibrated
   - Test teams trained and prepared

---

### Risk #2: Zero Float Before L4 Commissioning

**Risk Level:** CRITICAL

**Impact:** Any construction delay pushes into commissioning window, compressing already tight schedule

**Mitigation:**
1. **Construction schedule monitoring:**
   - Weekly construction progress reviews starting Dec 2025
   - Early warning system for slippage
   - Expedited punch list process

2. **Commissioning preparation during construction:**
   - Begin pre-functional checklists as soon as areas are accessible
   - Document installation issues immediately
   - Correct deficiencies during construction (not during Cx)

3. **Contingency plan:**
   - Identify "must-have" vs. "nice-to-have" commissioning tests
   - Prioritized test list if time is compressed further
   - Acceptance criteria flexibility (within safety limits)

---

### Risk #3: Customer Activity Overlap with L5 Testing

**Risk Level:** MEDIUM-HIGH

**Impact:** Customer rack installation may conflict with failure mode testing

**Mitigation:**
1. **Coordination protocol:**
   - Daily coordination meetings with customer (Apr 7-13)
   - Agreed-upon blackout periods for testing
   - Customer notification 24 hours before any planned outage

2. **Testing schedule optimization:**
   - Night shift testing for disruptive scenarios
   - Weekend testing if customer allows
   - Prioritize non-disruptive tests during business hours

3. **Phased handoff approach:**
   - Consider partial handoff by zone/block
   - Complete L5 testing on handed-off sections first
   - Sequential zone commissioning if possible

---

### Risk #4: Training & Documentation Timeline

**Risk Level:** MEDIUM

**Impact:** No explicit time allocated for training or final documentation

**Mitigation:**
1. **Concurrent training:**
   - Train operations staff during L4/L5 testing
   - Hands-on training as part of testing activities
   - "Shadow" commissioning team during tests

2. **Progressive documentation:**
   - Test reports completed within 24 hours of each test
   - Running deficiency log updated daily
   - Draft O&M manual sections during construction

3. **Post-handoff completion:**
   - Final documentation delivery within 2 weeks of handoff
   - Training completion certification by May 15, 2026

---

## Recommended Schedule Adjustments

### Adjustment #1: Accelerate Pre-Functional Work

**Current:** Pre-functional work begins Mar 18, 2026

**Recommended:** Begin pre-functional checklists Jan 2026

**Benefit:**
- Reduces L4 commissioning scope
- Identifies installation deficiencies early
- Allows correction during construction

**Implementation:**
- Issue pre-functional checklists to contractors: December 2025
- CxA spot-check verification: January-February 2026
- Final pre-functional sign-off: March 15, 2026

---

### Adjustment #2: Formalize Startup as L2/L3 Commissioning

**Current:** "Startup" phase (Feb-Mar) treated as construction activity

**Recommended:** Rebrand as "L2/L3 Commissioning" with formal procedures

**Benefit:**
- Commissioning credit for startup activities
- Reduces L4 scope
- Better documentation and quality control

**Implementation:**
- Commissioning Authority witnesses all startups
- Startup procedures = L2/L3 test procedures
- Startup reports = commissioning test reports

---

### Adjustment #3: Request 1-Week Extension for L4

**Current:** L4 commissioning = 14 days (Mar 18 - Apr 6)

**Recommended:** L4 commissioning = 21 days (Mar 11 - Apr 6)

**Benefit:**
- Additional week reduces critical time pressure
- Allows more thorough testing
- Provides buffer for unexpected issues

**Impact on Schedule:**
- Requires "H Interior Ready for L4" milestone moved from Mar 17 to Mar 10
- May require construction acceleration or parallel work

---

### Adjustment #4: Defer Non-Critical L5 Tests

**Current:** All L5 testing during Apr 7-13 (concurrent with customer)

**Recommended:** Complete critical L5 tests Apr 7-9; defer non-critical to May

**Benefit:**
- Reduces conflict with customer activities
- Focuses on mission-critical failure modes
- Allows customer access with minimal disruption

**Critical L5 Tests (Apr 7-9):**
- Single UPS module failure (per block)
- STS automatic transfer (load continuity verification)
- Basic N+1 redundancy verification

**Deferred L5 Tests (Post-handoff, May 2026):**
- Extended failure mode scenarios
- Grid disturbance simulations
- Load growth scenarios
- Maintenance bypass procedures

- **Construction + Startup:** Nov 24, 2025 - Mar 17, 2026 (~16 weeks)
- **L4 Commissioning:** Mar 18 - Apr 6, 2026 (**14 days only**)
- **L5 Commissioning:** Apr 7-13, 2026 (**5 days only**)
- **Customer Handoff:** Apr 30, 2026

**Critical Success Factors:**

1. **Treat construction startup phase (Feb-Mar) as L2/L3 commissioning**
2. **Parallel, multi-team approach during 14-day L4 window**
3. **Pre-functional work completed before Mar 18**
4. **Flexible L5 approach with post-handoff deferrals if needed**
5. **Zero tolerance for construction delays past Mar 17**

**Recommended Next Steps:**

1. Update commissioning plan document with actual schedule dates
2. Issue formal commissioning schedule to all stakeholders
3. Request schedule review meeting with owner and GC
