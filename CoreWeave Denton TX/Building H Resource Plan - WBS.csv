,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRITICAL NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1. Busway Testing Hours: The 24000 LF of busway x 0.1 hrs/LF = 2400 hours dominates L4 testing. This assumes testing EVERY linear foot. In practice commissioning uses representative sampling (e.g. test 10% of busway runs thoroughly). If sampling approach reduces this to 240 hours instead of 2400 hours the total L4 hours drop from 9334 to 7174 hours and daily average drops from 667 hrs/day to 512 hrs/day. RECOMMENDATION: Clarify busway testing scope—full testing or statistical sampling?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2. L4 Schedule Intensity: Even with reduced busway hours (512 hrs/day) this requires 12-13 FTE working 40-hour weeks or 6-7 FTE working extended shifts (10-12 hour days). The 14-day L4 window is EXTREMELY compressed for this scope of work. The parallel team approach is ESSENTIAL to meet schedule.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3. Manufacturer Support: During L2/L3 startup (Feb 9 - Mar 17) manufacturer representatives are CRITICAL for initial energization of UPS chillers and major equipment. These costs are typically included in equipment purchase but must be scheduled well in advance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4. Test Equipment: Load banks (3000kW + 800kW units) must be reserved and scheduled by January 2026 at latest. Lead time for large load bank rental can be 8-12 weeks. Budget: ~$50-100K for 4-week rental during L3/L4 phases.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5. Weekend/Extended Hours: The 14-day L4 schedule will almost certainly require weekend work and extended shifts (10-12 hour days). Budget for overtime labor costs and ensure contractor agreements allow for extended hours.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6. Customer Coordination (L5): The L5 phase (Apr 7-13) intentionally uses minimal hours (119 total ~24 hrs/day) because it must coordinate with customer rack installation and CDU commissioning. More extensive reliability testing may need to be deferred to post-handoff period.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7. Contingency: This plan includes 24 hours for deficiency re-testing in L4. Actual deficiency correction hours will vary. Recommend 10-15% labor hour contingency budget for unanticipated issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
