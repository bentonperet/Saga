**Re:** Proposal for Building H Data Center Commissioning Services (42 MW IT Load)

---

Dear CoreWeave Team,

PACHYDERM GLOBAL is pleased to submit this proposal for commissioning services for Building H at your Denton South data center campus. We recognize the strategic importance of this project to CoreWeave's continued growth in the hyperscale AI infrastructure market, and we are committed to delivering a commissioning program that sets a new benchmark for safety, speed, and quality.

## Why This Opportunity Matters to PACHYDERM GLOBAL

CoreWeave has earned recognition as the only **Platinum-tier GPU cloud provider** in SemiAnalysis's comprehensive ClusterMAX™ Rating System, distinguishing you from all other providers including major hyperscalers. This achievement reflects CoreWeave's commitment to operational excellence, technical innovation, and customer-centric infrastructure delivery.

Building H represents your final large building in the Denton South campus rollout; an opportunity to demonstrate that CoreWeave doesn't simply meet industry standards but **sets the benchmarks** that others aspire to achieve.

We understand what this means: Building H's commissioning partner selection is not just a technical procurement decision. It's a strategic choice that signals to your Tier-1 hyperscale AI clients whether CoreWeave operates at world-class standards or conventional industry norms.

## Our Strategic Focus on Building H

While we are capable of supporting any building across your campus, **we are strategically focusing our proposal on Building H** for compelling reasons:

**Independent System Demonstration:**
Building H operates as a standalone data center with complete MEP/FP infrastructure independent of other campus buildings. This creates the ideal environment to demonstrate our capabilities without integration dependencies on other buildings' commissioning timelines or quality standards.

**Clean Slate Performance Validation:**
No legacy issues or dependencies from prior building commissioning; clear baseline to measure our methodology's impact on schedule, quality, and safety; unambiguous accountability where our performance directly correlates to outcomes.

**Strategic Timing:**
Building H's April 2026 customer handoff provides adequate planning and mobilization runway while the aggressive 19-day L4/L5 timeline perfectly showcases our proactive quality methodology.

**Maximum Value Demonstration:**
Building H's complexity (18 generators, 72 UPS systems, 30 chillers, 42 MW capacity) allows us to demonstrate the full scope of our technical excellence, schedule protection capabilities, and Owner's Agent quality rigor.

## What Sets PACHYDERM GLOBAL Apart

**We are the firm that leading hyperscale operators hire to oversee their primary commissioning contractors.**

When top hyperscale AI operators build complex facilities or deploy at unprecedented scale, they engage PACHYDERM GLOBAL to provide independent Owner's Agent oversight; to catch what others miss, ensure nothing compromises safety or uptime, and validate that their primary commissioning contractors deliver world-class results.

**Why do they do this?** Because even the best commissioning agents miss critical issues on complex projects. The track record proves it:

- **100+ critical issues per phase** missed by primary CxA and caught by Owner's Agent oversight
- **100% of projects** have safety issues identified (electrical, mechanical, controls)
- **85% of projects** have integration gaps (multi-vendor equipment coordination)
- **70% of projects** have installation defects caught before energization/testing
- **$500K-$1M per MW** in avoided rework, downtime, delays, and liquidated damages

**For Building H, we offer two engagement pathways:**

**Option 1: Full Turnkey Commissioning (Primary CxA)**
You get the firm that hyperscalers trust to QA their CxAs, working directly for you. Complete capabilities including Digital Twin with Machine Learning for L4 commissioning (included in base scope), proactive QA/QC, real-time analytics, and Owner's Agent vigilance. Single point of accountability for quality and schedule.

**Option 2: Owner's Agent Oversight**
Independent quality assurance and program management throughout L2-L5 commissioning performed by others. Catches 15-20% more issues than primary CxA self-QA, provides third-party validation for client confidence, with optional Digital Twin technology to expedite commissioning.

## Our Mission for Building H

**"Set a new benchmark for safety, speed, and quality for CoreWeave in the eyes of its clients."**

This is not standard commissioning language. This is our commitment to excellence that goes beyond contract deliverables:

**Safety Benchmark:**
Zero safety incidents during 440+ equipment commissioning activities; 100% safety issue identification before energization; industry-leading protocols for 34.5kV medium-voltage work and 18-generator paralleling operations.

**Speed Benchmark:**
Protect aggressive 19-day L4/L5 commissioning window through proactive L1-L3 quality; achieve 95%+ first-pass functional test rates (vs. 60-75% industry average); eliminate 60-80% of field rework through Digital Twin virtual commissioning; identify issues 2-3 weeks early through predictive analytics.

**Quality Benchmark:**
Owner's Agent-level scrutiny applied to every system; independent third-party validation that catches 15-20% more issues than self-QA; 70% fewer post-COD punch list items; comprehensive documentation and training that sets operational excellence foundation.

## Why This Mission Matters

When CoreWeave's Tier-1 hyperscale AI clients evaluate Building H, they're not just evaluating infrastructure; they're evaluating **CoreWeave's commitment to excellence**. The commissioning partner you choose sends a clear signal:

- **Choose traditional commissioning:** "We meet standard requirements"
- **Choose PACHYDERM GLOBAL:** "We set the benchmark that others follow"

This mission; safety, speed, quality; becomes CoreWeave's competitive differentiator in the eyes of the world's most demanding infrastructure buyers.

## Strategic Value Beyond the Facility

**Market Credibility Through Third-Party Validation:**

When your hyperscale clients see PACHYDERM GLOBAL on your team (whether as Primary CxA or Owner's Agent), they recognize the firm they hire to oversee their own commissioning contractors. **The conversation shifts from "Can CoreWeave deliver?" to "CoreWeave uses the same Owner's Agent quality standard we trust."**

This isn't just commissioning; it's a deal-enabling credential that validates CoreWeave's capability and accelerates your clients' contract decisions.

**Campus Completion Excellence:**

Building H is the final large building in the Denton South campus. Prior buildings established operational capability. **Building H establishes the benchmark.** With PACHYDERM GLOBAL oversight, Building H becomes the reference standard that clients use to evaluate CoreWeave's quality commitment.

## Technology-Enabled Excellence

**Digital Twin with Machine Learning for L4-L5 Commissioning (Included in Option 1, Optional for Option 2):**

Traditional commissioning treats functional testing as trial-and-error field activities. For Building H's aggressive 19-day timeline, there is zero margin for iterative troubleshooting.

Our proprietary Digital Twin technology creates a virtual replica of Building H's control systems, enabling comprehensive pre-validation before physical commissioning:

- **Virtual L4-L5 testing environment** using actual BMS, EPMS, DCIM, SCADA control logic
- **Machine Learning predictive analytics** forecast which sequences will fail during L4
- **Pre-validate all integrated system scenarios** including failure modes safely in simulation
- **Resolve control logic issues in virtual environment** where changes are instantaneous
- **Field L4-L5 becomes validation** of pre-tested sequences, not discovery

**Measurable Benefits:**
- 60-80% reduction in L4-L5 field rework
- 95%+ first-pass functional test rates vs. 60-75% industry average
- 19-day commissioning timeline protected
- $200K-$500K saved per phase through elimination of field troubleshooting

**Proprietary Project Controls Platform:**

Lashica Woodard, our Mission-Critical Project Controls & P6 Scheduling Specialist (30-year career spanning Tesla, Lockheed, DOE programs), brings enterprise-grade scheduling and predictive analytics:

- **Primavera P6 integration** with master schedule tied to commissioning milestones
- **Machine Learning-powered delay forecasting** identifies issues 2-3 weeks before impact
- **Real-time dashboards** provide 24/7 stakeholder visibility
- **Predictive analytics prevent 80%** of potential delays from becoming actual schedule impact
