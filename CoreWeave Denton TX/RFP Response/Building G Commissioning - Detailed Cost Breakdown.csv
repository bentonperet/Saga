Average Blended Rate,$132.09,$132.24,"Similar ($0.15 difference)"
Cost per Day (L4),$38935,$47913,"-$8,978 (lower daily intensity)"

KEY DIFFERENCES:

1. L4 PHASE IMPACT:
   - Building G: 24 days at lower daily intensity (~$38.9K/day)
   - Building H: 14 days at higher daily intensity (~$47.9K/day)
   - Building G adds $263,660 in L4 labor due to 10 extra days

2. L5 PHASE SAVINGS:
   - Building G: Only 3 days (less customer activity overlap)
   - Building H: 5 days (coordinating with GB200 rack installation)
   - Building G saves $11,120 in L5 phase

3. STAFFING STRATEGY:
   - Building G: More conservative pace, potentially smaller peak team
   - Building H: Aggressive parallel testing, 13-person peak team
   - Both use same resources and rates from rate card

4. NET COST DIFFERENCE:
   - Building G is $290,421 MORE expensive (13.2% higher)
   - Primarily driven by longer L4 duration
   - Less pressure on overtime/extended shifts for Building G

======================================
CRITICAL COST OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITY
======================================

BUSWAY TESTING SCOPE REDUCTION (SAME FOR BOTH BUILDINGS):
Current approach: 24000 LF x 0.1 hrs/LF = 2400 hours in L4
Alternative sampling approach: Test 10% thoroughly = 240 hours

POTENTIAL SAVINGS FOR BUILDING G:
Labor hours saved: 2160 hours
Cost savings at $120-125/hr blended rate: $259200 - $270000
Revised L4 cost: $675,240 - $664,440
Revised total program cost: $2,234,184 - $2,223,384 (after contingency adjustment)

WITH BUSWAY SAMPLING:
Building G: ~$2.23M
Building H: ~$1.94M
Difference: ~$290K (still 13% higher for G due to longer schedule)

Note: Building G commissioning complete by early December 2025, significantly earlier than Building H (April 2026)


======================================
SCHEDULE ADVANTAGE FOR BUILDING G
======================================

FIRST BUILDING COMMISSIONED:
- Building G turnover: November 25, 2025
- Building H turnover: April 6, 2026
- Building G is operational 4.5 MONTHS EARLIER

REVENUE IMPLICATIONS:
If customer pays for operational capacity, Building G generates revenue ~130 days sooner
Potential early revenue offsets higher commissioning cost

LESSONS LEARNED:
Building G commissioning (first building) provides:
- Team training and experience
- Procedure refinement
- Issue identification early
- Knowledge transfer to later buildings (F, D, C, B, H)

This justifies the more conservative 24-day L4 schedule and higher cost.


======================================
FINAL RECOMMENDATION
======================================

Building G: $2,493,384 (27 days total, delivered Nov 25, 2025)
Building H: $2,202,963 (19 days total, delivered Apr 6, 2026)

Cost Difference: +$290,421 for Building G (+13.2%)
Time Difference: Building G delivered 4.5 months earlier

CONCLUSION:
Building G's higher cost is justified by:
1. First-building learning curve requiring conservative schedule
2. Earlier revenue generation (4.5 months ahead of Building H)
3. Knowledge capture benefits all subsequent buildings
4. Lower daily stress/intensity on commissioning team
5. More time for deficiency resolution without schedule pressure

Building H benefits from lessons learned, enabling more aggressive 14-day L4 schedule and lower overall cost.
