CRITICAL COST OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITY
======================================

BUSWAY TESTING SCOPE REDUCTION:
Current approach: 24000 LF x 0.1 hrs/LF = 2400 hours in L4
Alternative sampling approach: Test 10% thoroughly = 240 hours

POTENTIAL SAVINGS:
Labor hours saved: 2160 hours
Cost savings at $120-125/hr blended rate: $259200 - $270000
Revised L4 cost: $411580 - $400780
Revised total program cost: $1943763 - $1932963 (after contingency adjustment)

RECOMMENDATION:
Implement statistical sampling approach for busway testing per industry standard commissioning practices. Test 10% of busway runs thoroughly (representative samples from each block type) with 100% visual inspection and thermal imaging under load. This approach maintains quality assurance while reducing testing hours by 90%.

======================================
ASSUMPTIONS & NOTES
======================================

1. RATE CARD APPLICATION: All rates sourced from Cx_Rate_Card.csv with specific named resources where assigned. Floater positions use generic floater rates.

2. HOURS BASIS: Total hours (13,676) differ from WBS total (15,826) because:
   - WBS includes 2,400 busway hours in both L2 and L4 (4,800 total)
   - This estimate assumes those hours are INCLUDED in L2/L4 phases as shown
   - Discrepancy suggests need to clarify: are busway hours ADDITIONAL or INCLUDED in phase totals?
   - This pricing assumes busway hours are PART OF the phase totals not additional

3. BUSWAY TESTING: Priced at full scope (2,400 hrs in L4) but strongly recommend sampling approach to reduce by ~$260K

4. MANUFACTURER SUPPORT: Costs for UPS, chiller, and major equipment manufacturer startup technicians are typically included in equipment purchase and NOT reflected in this commissioning cost estimate.

5. OWNER RESPONSIBILITIES: Assumes owner provides:
   - Temporary power for testing
   - Access to water for chiller testing
   - Site office space and facilities
   - Safety equipment and site orientation
   - Coordination with construction contractors

6. CONTINGENCY: 15% contingency applied to cover:
   - Extended deficiency resolution
   - Schedule delays requiring extended mobilization
   - Unanticipated testing requirements
   - Weekend/overtime premium hours beyond base estimate

7. SCHEDULE RISK: The 14-day L4 window is EXTREMELY compressed. Any schedule delays in construction turnover will result in:
   - Compressed testing requiring additional overtime
   - Potential need for additional parallel resources
   - Higher contingency draw

8. COST COMPARISON: This estimate of $2.2M is approximately 2x higher than the initial WBS order-of-magnitude estimate of $1.04M because:
   - Uses actual Cx rate card rates (higher than generic loaded rates)
   - Includes proper management and coordination overhead
   - Accounts for parallel team structure in L4
   - Includes realistic contingency
   - Previous estimate may have underestimated coordination/management hours


======================================
NEXT STEPS / DECISIONS REQUIRED
======================================

1. APPROVE BUSWAY TESTING APPROACH: Full testing (2,400 hrs) vs. statistical sampling (240 hrs) - $260K cost impact

2. CONFIRM HOURS RECONCILIATION: Clarify if WBS busway hours are additive or inclusive in phase totals

3. REVIEW STAFFING ASSIGNMENTS: Confirm named resources from rate card are available for assigned phases

4. VALIDATE EQUIPMENT RENTAL COSTS: Confirm load bank availability and pricing for March-April 2026 timeframe

5. APPROVE CONTINGENCY LEVEL: 15% is recommended given schedule risk; confirm if acceptable or adjust

6. SCHEDULE RISK MITIGATION: Consider what happens if Building H construction delays by even 2-3 days given zero float
