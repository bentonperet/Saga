## Purpose

This template provides standardized Documentation Summary Checklists for tracking completion of all required commissioning documentation from Level 1 through Level 5. These checklists ensure:

- **Complete Documentation:** All required forms and reports submitted
- **Quality Control:** Documentation reviewed for accuracy and completeness
- **Progress Tracking:** Clear visibility of documentation status
- **Prerequisites:** Verification of prerequisites before advancing to next level
- **Final Closeout:** Comprehensive record of all commissioning documentation

## Instructions for Use

<!-- @claude When customizing this template:
1. Create individual checklist for EACH piece of equipment/system
2. Populate checklist items based on actual equipment requirements
3. Maintain checklists in Commissioning Software (CxAlloy)
4. Mark items complete only when documentation received and reviewed
5. Final line item confirms all documentation complete with no open issues
-->

### Checklist Development Process:

**Step 1: Equipment Identification**
- Work with GC/CM to develop complete equipment list
- Assign unique equipment tags per project naming convention
- Group equipment by system and discipline

**Step 2: Checklist Creation**
- Create checklist for each equipment tag
- Populate with expected documentation per equipment type
- Add project-specific requirements

**Step 3: Tracking and Maintenance**
- Update checklists as documentation received
- Flag missing or incomplete items
- Track through issues log if needed
- Verify completion before advancing levels

**Step 4: Verification**
- CxA reviews all submitted documentation
- Confirms accuracy and completeness
- Signs off on final checklist line item

## Integration with Commissioning Software

Per PGCIS Cx Standard Section 2.2, all Documentation Summary Checklists shall be created and maintained in the Commissioning Software (CxAlloy).

**Software Requirements:**
- Individual checklist for each equipment tag
- Line item for each documentation requirement
- Status tracking (Pending/Received/Reviewed/Complete)
- Ability to attach PDF files of actual documentation
- Final verification line item signed off by CxA
- Exportable to PDF and Excel

**Workflow:**
1. CxA creates checklists in software (or imports from template)
2. GC/CM uploads documentation as received
3. CxA reviews and marks items complete
4. Software tracks completion percentage
5. CxA signs off on final verification when all items complete
