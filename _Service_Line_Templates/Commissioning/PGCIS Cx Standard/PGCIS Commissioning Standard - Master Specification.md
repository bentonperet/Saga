### E. Level 5 Commissioning – Integrated System Testing (IST)

1. The IST is a test that is coordinated to ensure that site level systems are tested. The CxA shall direct the commissioning test with the assistance and support of the GC, installing contractors, and Manufacturers/Vendors.

2. The CxA shall review and modify standard Owner provided template ISTs to the greatest extent possible. All ISTs are to be owner approved prior to utilization. The ISTs are to be used with the Owner approved commissioning software platform to create site specific tests.

3. The IST is the final validation of the facility; it is a series of test procedures executed with no active human response to verify system automatic response to several anticipated situations. In particular, it validates the performance of the systems under the most severe operating conditions. It shall be directed by the CxA, with support provided by the GC/CM Installing Contractors and Manufacturer/Vendors as required. The Owner's staff may participate in the testing of any system being commissioned.

   - a) Testing procedures for IST shall be produced by the CxA based on the Owner's Requirements, Manufacturer/Vendor's data and in coordination with AOR/EOR, Owner. These procedures shall include clear testing steps and criteria for a test's passage or failure. These procedures shall be submitted to the Owner and AOR/EOR for review and for final approval no fewer than thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of Level 4 testing.

   - b) After the review process is complete, the test procedures shall be made available to the GC/CM and Manufacturer/Vendors for review no fewer than fifteen (15) working days prior to commencement of Level 4 testing. The intent of this review process is to ensure the tests are not destructive and meet the Owner's Requirements as applied to the systems and equipment tested.

   - c) GC/CM, Installing Contractors, and Owner shall review and submit their comments regarding IST procedures within ten (10) working days of receipt. After all comments are addressed, CxA shall issue IST procedures as final.

   - d) Once testing procedures are approved, they shall be distributed to the Owner, AOR/EOR, GC/CM and Manufacturer/Vendors by CxA no fewer than five (5) working days prior to commencement of Level 4 testing to prepare for test execution.

   - e) The IST shall not proceed until all equipment and systems have successfully passed their respective FPTs. Upon successful completion of all prerequisite activities for all system components, including the Building Automation System & EPMS, the IST may proceed.

   - f) IST shall be tested under various load levels in the various modes of operation, to confirm proper performance of the installed systems. This often requires extended days of operation; therefore, the GC/CM, Installing Contractors and Manufacturer/Vendors shall provide support as required to cover the duration of the proposed testing. Manufacturer/Vendors shall provide at least one (1) technician to be present on site during the course of IST.

   - g) At the end of IST, if the CxA finds any test results non-compliant with previously agreed upon equipment and system performance requirements as indicated in the test scripts or was unable to perform any aspect of the testing, the causes for the deviations shall be identified and corrected immediately. The CxA may require additional tests to verify that fixes have been completed and the performance is acceptable. In this case, GC/CM, Installing Contractors and Manufacturer/Vendors shall provide necessary support for any additional tests. Additional expenses associated with these additional tests shall be covered by the responsible contractor (i.e. GC/CM, Installing Contractors, Manufacturer/Vendors).

   - h) The CxA shall log all outstanding deficiencies in accordance with the deficiency list procedures listed within this specification.

   - i) If any portion of the scripted testing could not be completed , the CxA shall develop a plan for completing the required testing at a later date. This deferred testing plan will be reviewed and approved by the Owner.

   - j) All permanent AOR/EOR provided, Owner approved Arc Flash labeling shall be installed by the GC/CM no more than five (5) working days after receipt of Owner approved labeling.

### F. Commissioning Completion Criteria

Commissioning is completed when the work specific in this section and related sections has been completed and accepted by Owner and CxA, including, but not limited to, the following:

1. Completion of tests, validation of equipment specifications for performance, and acceptance of test results.

   - f) Data logging shall be performed for specific points of each system and saved for future analysis of the BAS. These points shall constitute the base data for the performance measurement of the building. The trend points shall remain active for use by the Owner's personnel after the warranty has expired. Data logging shall be done using the resident BAS points, power quality meters, and portable data loggers. Information shall be collected from the BMS and EPMS Manufacturer/Vendors and/or Owner by the CxA as part of the commissioning process. The CxA may require independent testing of random points.
   - g) During instances where the building is operating stably with load (i.e. mechanical room validations), points shall be trended and recorded throughout to ensure that Power Use Effectiveness (PUE) and Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) can be monitored and/or calculated through entirety of test.

4. **System Alarm Logs:** Record and print out a log of alarms that occurred since the last log was printed. Evaluate alarms to determine if the previous day's work resulted in any conditions that are not considered "normal operation."
   - a) Conditions that are not considered "normal operation" shall be reported on a commissioning issue report attached to the alarm log. Resolve as necessary. The intent of this requirement is to discover control system points or sequences left in manual or disabled conditions, equipment left disconnected, set points left with abnormal values, or similar conditions that may have resulted from failure to fully restore systems to normal, automatic control after test completion.
