## 0.08 BUDGET & COST MANAGEMENT

### Preliminary Cost Estimate (Order of Magnitude)

**Project Scope:** 50,000 GSF, 3 MW Phase 1 IT load, Tier III

| Cost Category | Estimated Cost | $/SF | % of Total |
|---------------|----------------|------|------------|
| **Site Work (Div 31-32)** | $2,500,000 | $50 | 8% |
| **Building Shell (Div 02-14)** | $7,500,000 | $150 | 23% |
| **Electrical (Div 26)** | $12,000,000 | $240 | 37% |
| **Mechanical (Div 23)** | $8,000,000 | $160 | 25% |
| **Fire Protection (Div 21)** | $500,000 | $10 | 2% |
| **Controls & Security (Div 25, 28)** | $1,000,000 | $20 | 3% |
| **Commissioning** | $500,000 | $10 | 2% |
| **Subtotal (Construction)** | $32,000,000 | $640 | 100% |
| **Design fees (8%)** | $2,560,000 | $51 | — |
| **Permitting & fees (1%)** | $320,000 | $6 | — |
| **Owner contingency (10%)** | $3,200,000 | $64 | — |
| **TOTAL PROJECT COST** | **$38,080,000** | **$762** | — |

**Cost per MW (IT load):** ~$12.7M per MW

**Notes:**
- Costs assume greenfield site (no demolition or remediation)
- Medium-voltage electrical service (345 kV transmission with customer-owned substation → 13.8 kV distribution)
- Precast tilt-up construction (not PEMB)
- FM 1-150 tornado-rated roof
- N+1 mechanical, 2N electrical architecture

### Cost Control Measures

**Value Engineering (VE) Opportunities:**
- **Building shell:** PEMB vs. precast (savings: $1-2M; trade-off: insurance costs, tornado risk)
- **Electrical topology:** 2N vs. N+1 with STS (savings: ~$1M; trade-off: uptime)
- **Cooling efficiency:** Standard vs. high-efficiency chillers (higher capex, lower opex; payback analysis)
- **Roof:** FM 1-150 vs. FM 1-90 (savings: $400K; trade-off: insurance, wind rating)

**Change Order Management:**
- **Change order log:** Track all changes with cost/schedule impact
- **Owner approval thresholds:**
  - <$10K and <5 days: Design-builder approval
  - $10K-$50K or 5-15 days: Owner project manager approval
  - >$50K or >15 days: Owner executive approval
- **Contingency drawdown:** Track against 10% owner contingency; report monthly
