## OVERVIEW

Multi-layered physical security system protects personnel, IT equipment, and facility infrastructure through defense-in-depth security zoning, access control, video surveillance, and intrusion detection integrated with BMS/DCIM for centralized monitoring.

**Design Philosophy:**
- **Layered defense model:** Security zones with progressive access controls (CP 1 through CP 5)
- **ISO 27001:2022 alignment:** Physical security controls support Information Security Management System (ISMS)
- **Integration:** All systems monitored from Security Control Room (SCR) with 99.982% availability target
- **Compliance:** SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, PCI DSS physical security requirements
- **Life safety priority:** Security systems override on fire alarm (egress first)

---

## SECURITY ZONE FRAMEWORK

The data center is divided into distinct security zones creating a layered defense model with specific Control Points (CP) that correspond to progressive security challenges. Each zone transition as a normal means of access requires access control. Emergency egress doors are alarmed.

### Security Zone Definitions

| Zone Color | Control Point | Definition & Access Requirements |
|------------|---------------|----------------------------------|
| **Violet** | CP 1 | Inside perimeter fence but outside building envelope. Includes parking lots, equipment yards, generator areas. **Access:** Perimeter gates with card reader/intercom |
| **Blue** | CP 2 | Visitor reception areas inside building but outside private offices and critical areas. Includes security vestibule lobbies, designated conference rooms/restrooms. **Access:** Building entry mantrap with card reader |
| **Yellow** | CP 3 | Access-controlled private office areas for customers and PACHYDERM personnel. **Access:** Card reader from Blue Zone |
| **Orange** | CP 4 | Secure data center premises restricted to authorized personnel with special access clearance. Includes data halls (DH1, DH2). **Access:** Card + biometric (MFA) via CICO checkpoint |
| **Red** | CP 5 | Most critical spaces protecting essential operations. Includes electrical rooms (PDMs, transformers), mechanical rooms (chillers, pumps), SCR, network rooms (MDF/IDF). **Access:** Card + biometric (MFA), highest clearance |
| **Black** | N/A | Construction zones not yet operational, physically separated from active areas. **Access:** Dedicated construction access, temporary barriers |

### Risk Level Classification

SAGA assesses threat level for each site. The Pryor Data Center is classified as **High Risk (HR)** due to:
- Critical infrastructure role in data center operations
- Tornado Alley location requiring enhanced physical protection
- High-value IT assets and sensitive customer data

|-------------|------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Perimeter Berm** | Not required | **Required** |
| **Perimeter Lighting** | Reactive (motion) | **Persistent (always on)** |
| **Main Vehicle Entrance** | K4-rated arrestor | **Sally Port with K4** |
| **Pedestrian Entrances** | Standard gate | **Full-height turnstiles** |
| **Fence-to-Building Standoff** | 45 ft (15 m) min | **100 ft (30 m) min** |
| **Permanent Visitor Center** | Not required | **Required at gate** |
| **Exterior Orange Zone Doors** | Standard | **15-min forced entry resistance** |
| **SCR Transaction Window** | 4×6 in. opening | **Solid with transaction drawer** |
| **Roof Surveillance** | Inside doors only | **Inside + outside with thermal** |

## SECURE NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE FOR SECURITY SYSTEMS

The electronic security systems are critical infrastructure requiring protection from cyber threats that could compromise physical security.

### Physically Separate and Logically Segmented Network

**Network Separation:**
- All electronic security systems (ACS, CCTV, IDS, management servers) operate on network physically separate from:
  - Corporate IT networks
  - Operational technology (OT) networks
  - Guest networks
- Logical segmentation (VLANs with strict firewall rules) where physical separation not fully feasible
- Design goal: maximum isolation

**Network Inaccessibility:**
- Security systems network inaccessible from internet and any non-security internal networks
- Data exchange (monitoring dashboards, log aggregation) facilitated through:
  - Tightly controlled unidirectional or bidirectional data diode, OR
  - Demilitarized zone (DMZ) with robust firewall policies
- No direct network routing between security and other networks

**Protected Network Infrastructure:**
- Core network infrastructure (switches, routers, firewalls) for security systems:
  - Located within access-controlled Red Zones
  - All unnecessary ports and services disabled
  - Hardened configurations per industry best practices

**Power Resilience:**
- Entire security systems network infrastructure (all active network components and endpoint devices) powered by:
  - Facility UPS systems
  - Backup generators
  - Ensures continuous operation during mains power failure

**Security Monitoring:**
- Security systems network monitored for:
  - Unauthorized access attempts
  - Anomalous traffic patterns
- Logs from network security devices (firewalls) aggregated and reviewed
- Integration with Security Operations Center (SOC) monitoring

## PHYSICAL PROTECTION OF SECURITY SYSTEM COMPONENTS

All field devices and interconnecting infrastructure must be physically protected against tampering, sabotage, and environmental damage.

### Tamper-Proof Enclosures

**Requirements:**
- All field devices installed in tamper-proof enclosures:
  - Access control readers
  - Intercoms
  - CCTV cameras
  - Intrusion Detection System (IDS) panels
  - Motion detectors
- Enclosure construction: hardened steel or polycarbonate materials
- Integrated tamper switches on all enclosures
- Unauthorized opening, removal, or impact generates immediate tamper alarm in SCR identifying specific device

### Protected Cabling and Conduit

**Cabling Protection Requirements:**

**Mandatory Rigid Steel Conduit Locations:**
- All exterior areas
- Vulnerable locations (loading docks, publicly accessible lobbies, perimeter fences)
- Pathways above accessible ceilings
- Entire Violet Zone (CP 1)

- Continuous conduit runs, securely grounded

**Network Infrastructure Access:**
- Network infrastructure (switches, patch panels) supporting security system:
  - Housed within locked cabinets
  - Located in access-controlled Red Zones
  - Access restricted to authorized personnel only

### Secured Mounting and Accessibility

- Devices mounted at height/orientation minimizing physical damage risk while maintaining operational effectiveness
- Critical components elevated or recessed where possible
- Service access controlled and logged
