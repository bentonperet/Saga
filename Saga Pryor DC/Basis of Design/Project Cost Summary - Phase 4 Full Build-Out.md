**Validation Notes:**

**Confidence Assessment:**
- Overall project estimate confidence: **±25%** (Budgetary level estimate, suitable for financing and decision-making)
- High-confidence divisions (±20-25%): Electrical, Construction, Security
- Medium-confidence divisions (±25-30%): HVAC (liquid cooling market pricing), Site (pre-geotech), Communications (evolving DCIM market)
- Soft costs: **±20-30%** depending on financing terms and market conditions

**Industry Benchmark Validation:**
- **Total facility cost:** $265.8M for 22 MW IT load = **$12.08M/MW**
- **AI data center industry range:** $9-14M/MW (high-density, liquid-cooled)
- **Conventional data center range:** $8-12M/MW (air-cooled only)
- **Assessment:** Our estimate is **well-aligned with industry benchmarks for AI-optimized facilities:**
  - Comprehensive liquid cooling ($30M CDU/RDHx) reflects AI-ready infrastructure
  - Tornado hardening adds premium (~$2-3M) but reduces insurance costs
  - 161 kV utility service requires significant substation investment
  - Self-healing MV dual-ring provides Tier III redundancy efficiently
  - Oklahoma location factor moderates costs vs. coastal metros
  - Soft costs at 13.8% reflect project complexity (vs. 10-12% typical)

**Comparison to Original Simple Factors:**
- Original target: **$11M/MW** ($242M for 22 MW)
- Updated comprehensive estimate: **$12.08M/MW** ($265.8M)
- Variance: **+10%** driven by:
  - More detailed soft cost breakdown (+$7M vs. original)
  - Comprehensive DCIM and monitoring (+$6M)
  - Enhanced commissioning scope (+$2M)
  - Additional owner's contingency reserve (+$10M)
