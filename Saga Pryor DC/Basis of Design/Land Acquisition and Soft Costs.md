## 4.0 NOTES & ASSUMPTIONS

### 4.1 Soft Costs Industry Standards

- **Typical Range:** 10-20% of hard costs for data center projects
- **This Project:** $36.7M / $200M hard costs = **18.4%** (higher end due to complexity)
- **Key Drivers:**
  - 161 kV utility interconnection complexity
  - Tier III certification requirements
  - Tornado hardening adds design/review time
  - Liquid cooling commissioning complexity
  - AI-optimized infrastructure requires specialized expertise

### 4.2 Financing Cost Assumptions

- **Construction Loan:** $250M total facility cost
- **Average Drawn Balance:** $200M (assumes progressive draw over 24 months)
- **Interest Rate:** 6% annual
- **Duration:** 24 months construction period
- **Capitalized Interest:** $12M (included in project cost basis)

### 4.3 Cost Reduction Opportunities

1. **Financing:** Lower interest rates or equity financing could reduce by $8-10M
2. **Owner Self-Perform:** PM self-performed could save $2-3M
3. **Phased Approach:** Defer some pre-operational costs to later phases
4. **Value Engineering:** Systematic reviews during design can reduce hard costs, lowering soft cost percentages

**Next Steps:**
1. Engage real estate broker for land acquisition (120-acre parcels in Pryor area)
2. Secure financing term sheet (construction loan + equity)
3. Hire owner's project manager during design phase
4. Engage independent commissioning agent at 30% design
5. Obtain builder's risk insurance quotes
