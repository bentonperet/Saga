### 12.9.6 Application of Soft Costs to Project Budget

**Equipment Costs in Section 12.3 (Revised Estimate):**

The equipment costs shown in Section 12.3 represent **material/equipment procurement only** and exclude:
- ❌ Installation labor and EC overhead/profit
- ❌ Engineering and design fees
- ❌ Commissioning and testing costs
- ❌ Project contingency

**Soft Costs Applied at Aggregated Project Level:**

These multipliers will be applied in the **aggregated project budget** across all divisions:

```
PHASE 4 ELECTRICAL DIVISION (EXAMPLE CALCULATION)

Equipment Cost (from Section 12.3):        $70.8M - $126.9M

Add Soft Costs:
├─ Labor & Installation (18-33%):          +$12.7M - $41.9M
├─ Engineering & Design (4.5-5%):          +$3.2M - $6.3M
├─ Commissioning & Testing (3-4%):         +$2.1M - $5.1M
└─ Subtotal (before contingency):          $88.8M - $180.2M

Add Contingency (12.5% of subtotal):       +$11.1M - $22.5M

TOTAL ELECTRICAL DIVISION (FULLY-LOADED):  $99.9M - $202.7M

Cost per kW (24 MW IT load):               $4,163/kW - $8,446/kW
```

**Division-Specific Multipliers:**

Each division will have different labor percentages based on prefabrication level:

| Division | Equipment | Labor % | Eng % | Comm % | Cont % | Total Multiplier |
|----------|-----------|---------|-------|--------|--------|------------------|
| **Electrical (Div 26)** | $70.8-126.9M | 18-33% | 4.5-5% | 3-4% | 12.5% | **1.41-1.60×** |
| **Mechanical (Div 23)** | TBD | 30-45% | 4.5-5% | 3-4% | 12.5% | **1.57-1.74×** |
| **Fire Protection (Div 21)** | TBD | 35-50% | 3-4% | 2-3% | 12.5% | **1.59-1.77×** |
| **Architectural (Div 00)** | TBD | 40-60% | 5-6% | 1-2% | 12.5% | **1.66-1.88×** |
| **Site/Civil (Div 33)** | TBD | 25-40% | 3-4% | 1-2% | 12.5% | **1.48-1.66×** |

**Fully-Loaded Project Cost Formula:**

```
Total Project Cost = Σ (Equipment Cost × Division Multiplier) across all divisions
```

**This approach provides:**
- ✅ Consistency: Same methodology across all divisions
- ✅ Flexibility: Adjust multipliers in one place (aggregated budget)
- ✅ Transparency: Clear separation of equipment vs. soft costs
- ✅ Accuracy: Division-specific rates based on actual construction methods

### 12.9.7 Summary: Soft Cost Multipliers for Aggregated Budget

**Quick Reference Table for Project Budget Integration:**

| Cost Category | Range | Typical | Basis | Confidence |
|--------------|-------|---------|-------|------------|
| **Labor & Installation** | 18-33% | 25% | % of equipment | ±25% (Medium) |
| **Engineering & Design** | 4.5-5% | 4.75% | % of equipment | ±20% (Medium-High) |
| **Commissioning & Testing** | 3-4% | 3.5% | % of equipment | ±20% (Medium-High) |
| **Subtotal Soft Costs** | 25.5-42% | 33.25% | % of equipment | ±22% (Medium) |
| **Contingency** | 12.5% | 12.5% | % of subtotal | ±10% (High) |
| **Total Multiplier** | **1.41-1.60×** | **1.50×** | Equipment → Fully-loaded | ±20% (Medium-High) |

**Example: Electrical Division Phase 4**
- Equipment: $70.8M - $126.9M (Section 12.3 revised estimate)
- **Typical multiplier: 1.50×**
- **Fully-loaded: $106.2M - $190.4M**
