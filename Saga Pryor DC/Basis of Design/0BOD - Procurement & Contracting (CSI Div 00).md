## OVERVIEW

CSI Division 00 establishes the contract strategy, procurement approach, and delivery methods for the Pryor Data Center project. This division defines how the project will be organized, procured, and executed to meet schedule, budget, and performance requirements while minimizing risk.

**Key Objectives:**
- **Delivery method:** Select optimal project delivery approach (Design-Build, CMAR, etc.)
- **Procurement strategy:** Balance competitive pricing with proven Tier III vendors
- **Risk allocation:** Clear contractual roles for design, construction, commissioning, and performance
- **Schedule optimization:** Parallel design, procurement, and construction to meet 24-month timeline
- **Quality assurance:** Vendor pre-qualification and performance guarantees

## 2.0 PROCUREMENT STRATEGY

### Phased Procurement Approach

**Phase 1: Design-Builder Selection (RFP Process)**
- **RFQ (Request for Qualifications):** Pre-qualify 3-5 design-build teams based on:
- **RFP (Request for Proposal):** Issue to pre-qualified teams

**Phase 2: Long-Lead Equipment Procurement**
- **Critical path items** (order during design development, XX months into project):
  - Transformers (XX weeks)
  - Medium-voltage switchgear (XX weeks lead time)
  - UPS systems (XX weeks)
  - Generators (XX weeks)
  - Chillers (XX weeks)
  
- **Procurement approach:**
  - **Design-assist:** Major vendors (e.g., Schneider, Caterpillar, Carrier) provide input during design
  - **Performance specifications:** Define output requirements (kW, efficiency, redundancy) vs. prescriptive specs
  - **Sole-source justification:** For standardized equipment or proven integrations (e.g., UPS + EPMS from same vendor)
  - **Competitive bidding:** Where multiple vendors meet Tier III requirements (e.g., chillers, cooling towers)

**Phase 3: Subcontractor Procurement**
- **Bid packages** issued after 95% design:
  - Site work (grading, utilities, paving)
  - Precast tilt-up panels (fabrication + erection)
  - Roofing (FM 1-150 system)
  - Electrical (conduit, wire, terminations, testing)
  - Mechanical (piping, ductwork, TAB)
  - Fire protection (sprinkler, pre-action, fire alarm)
  - Low-voltage (BMS, access control, CCTV)
