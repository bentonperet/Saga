# BASIS OF DESIGN - PROCUREMENT & CONTRACTING
## CSI Division 00
### Pryor Data Center - PACHYDERM GLOBAL

**Parent Document:** [[Saga Pryor DC/Basis of Design/Erik_BOD_Updated/_BOD - Exec Summary and TOC]]

## OVERVIEW

CSI Division 00 establishes the contract strategy, procurement approach, and delivery methods for the Pryor Data Center project. This division defines how the project will be organized, procured, and executed to meet schedule, budget, and performance requirements while minimizing risk.

**Key Objectives:**
- **Delivery method:** Select optimal project delivery approach (Design-Build, CMAR, etc.)
- **Procurement strategy:** Balance competitive pricing with proven Tier III vendors
- **Risk allocation:** Clear contractual roles for design, construction, commissioning, and performance
- **Schedule optimization:** Parallel design, procurement, and construction to meet 24-month timeline
- **Quality assurance:** Vendor pre-qualification and performance guarantees

---

## 0.01 PROJECT DELIVERY METHOD

### Recommended Delivery Method: **Design-Build (DB)**

**Rationale:**
- **Single-point responsibility:** One contract for design and construction reduces owner risk
- **Schedule compression:** Overlap design, procurement, and construction (fast-track)
- **Integrated team:** Design-builder coordinates architect, MEP engineer, and trades
- **Performance guarantees:** PUE, uptime, capacity targets contractually enforceable
- **Cost certainty:** Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) locked after design development

**Alternative Delivery Methods Considered:**

| Method | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|--------|------|------|----------------|
| **Design-Bid-Build (DBB)** | Competitive bidding; clear design-construction separation | Sequential (slower); design-construction conflicts; no early input from trades | ❌ Not recommended (schedule risk) |
| **Construction Manager at Risk (CMAR)** | Early GC involvement; pre-construction services; GMP option | Two contracts (architect + CMAR); coordination burden on owner | ⚠️ Acceptable alternative if owner prefers more control |
| **Integrated Project Delivery (IPD)** | Shared risk/reward; high collaboration | Complex legal structure; limited availability of IPD-experienced teams | ❌ Not practical for this project |
| **Design-Build (DB)** | Single contract; fast-track; performance guarantees; proven for data centers | Less owner control over design details; requires strong RFP and oversight | ✅ **Recommended** |

---

## 0.02 PROCUREMENT STRATEGY

### Phased Procurement Approach

**Phase 1: Design-Builder Selection (RFP Process)**
- **RFQ (Request for Qualifications):** Pre-qualify 3-5 design-build teams based on:
  - Data center experience (Tier III or higher)
  - Project portfolio (5+ data centers >5 MW in last 5 years)
  - Financial capacity (bonding, insurance)
  - Key personnel (project manager, MEP lead, commissioning experience)
  
- **RFP (Request for Proposal):** Issue to pre-qualified teams
  - Scope: Conceptual design, cost estimate, schedule, risk plan
  - Evaluation criteria (weighted):
    - **40%** - Price (GMP proposal)
    - **30%** - Technical approach (design, systems, redundancy)
    - **20%** - Schedule and risk mitigation
    - **10%** - Team qualifications and references
  
- **Selection:** Best-value award (not lowest price)
  - Negotiate GMP after design development (65% design)
  - Contract structure: Cost-plus-fee with GMP, or lump-sum turnkey

**Phase 2: Long-Lead Equipment Procurement**
- **Critical path items** (order during design development, 4-6 months into project):
  - Medium-voltage switchgear (20-32 weeks lead time)
  - UPS systems (16-24 weeks)
  - Generators (16-20 weeks)
  - Chillers (12-16 weeks)
  - Transformers (12-16 weeks)

- **Procurement approach:**
  - **Design-assist:** Major vendors (e.g., Schneider, Caterpillar, Carrier) provide input during design
  - **Performance specifications:** Define output requirements (kW, efficiency, redundancy) vs. prescriptive specs
  - **Sole-source justification:** For standardized equipment or proven integrations (e.g., UPS + EPMS from same vendor)
  - **Competitive bidding:** Where multiple vendors meet Tier III requirements (e.g., chillers, cooling towers)

**Phase 3: Subcontractor Procurement**
- **Bid packages** issued after 95% design:
  - Site work (grading, utilities, paving)
  - Precast tilt-up panels (fabrication + erection)
  - Roofing (FM 1-150 system)
  - Electrical (conduit, wire, terminations, testing)
  - Mechanical (piping, ductwork, TAB)
  - Fire protection (sprinkler, pre-action, fire alarm)
  - Low-voltage (BMS, access control, CCTV)

- **Subcontractor pre-qualification:**
  - Prior data center or mission-critical experience
  - NETA certification (electrical testing)
  - AABC/NEBB certification (test & balance)
  - Financial stability and bonding capacity

## SUMMARY

CSI Division 00 establishes the procurement and contracting framework for the Pryor Data Center project. Key elements include:

✅ **Delivery Method:** Design-Build (DB) with Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) for fast-track schedule, single-point responsibility, and performance guarantees  
✅ **Procurement Strategy:** Phased approach with early engagement of long-lead vendors (switchgear, UPS, generators, chillers); competitive bidding for subcontractors  
✅ **Vendor Selection:** Tier 1 vendors only for critical systems; pre-qualification based on experience, financial stability, and service network  
✅ **Risk Allocation:** Design-builder assumes design and construction risk; owner retains site conditions and utility coordination risk; shared responsibility for permitting  
✅ **Performance Guarantees:** PUE ≤ 1.4 at 50% load, Tier III uptime, 3 MW capacity; liquidated damages and early completion incentives  
✅ **Quality Assurance:** Independent CxA, factory acceptance tests, third-party material testing, and rigorous commissioning  

**Next Steps:**
- Issue RFQ to pre-qualify design-build teams (3-5 firms)
- Issue RFP to shortlisted teams with Owner's Project Requirements (OPR) and Basis of Design
- Evaluate proposals and award contract (best-value, not lowest price)
- Negotiate GMP after 65% design development
- Begin long-lead equipment procurement immediately after contract award
