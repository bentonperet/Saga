### Things to add to requests, perhaps?
#### Background

Saga is requesting multiple things:

We have an engineering consultant performing the following tasks. The site visit will most likely be mid-late October, and the reports will be available in early November. 
- Critical Issues Analysis for cultural and ecological resources 
- Permitting Matrix 
- ALTA/SNPS Land Survey 
- Phase 1 ESA 
- Water Delineation Study 
- Desktop Geotechnical Analysis 

We also have another consultant conducting the following studies, which should be available within 4-5 weeks. 
- SPP Oklahoma Market Study 
- Net Load Analysis 
- Fiber Analysis2 are an ALTA Survey and a Geotech

#### Things to add?
- **Topographic survey / slope contours / spot elevations** — ALTA can include topography as a Table A item, but that must be requested. If you need detailed slope/drainage modeling or contours for pad siting, ask for a separate topo or confirm Table A topo scope.

- **Whether the desktop geotech includes recommended field boring locations and timing** — desktop studies are preliminary; confirm whether Phase II (borings) is planned and when.
	- 
- - “Will the desktop geotech include **recommended boring locations and a schedule/cost estimate** for the Phase II field program?”
    
- “If RECs or unfavorable soils are indicated, will you include a proposed scope for borings (counts, depths, lab tests) and mobilization time?”
    
- “What minimum boring density do you recommend to support foundation and slab design for a 10–12 MW facility on this parcel?”
