## Relevance to Saga Pryor DC

### Cooling System Considerations from Feasibility Memo

1. **Adiabatic Cooling (ADC):**
   - Uses water for evaporative pre-cooling
   - Question from Feasibility Memo (line 69): "Have hybrid air-cooled chillers been evaluated as an alternative?"
   - Erik's notes suggest air-cooled chillers with free cooling are recommended

2. **Free-Cooling Chillers (CH):**
   - XRAF3612G model has integrated free-cooling capability
   - Screw compressors standard in this design

3. **Climate Analysis Required:**
   - RD109 sized for Dallas (hot/humid) or San Francisco (mild/dry)
   - Pryor, OK climate needs psychrometric chart analysis
   - Must verify chiller performs well in Oklahoma climate zone

4. **Water Usage:**
   - Adiabatic fluid coolers use water (concerns in Feasibility Memo line 1143)
   - Saga preference: closed-loop system for sustainability story

### Questions for PGCIS Team

- Should Pryor use Dallas configuration (5× ADC) or optimize for Oklahoma climate?
- Evaluate hybrid air-cooled chillers vs. adiabatic assist (per Erik's recommendation)
- Size thermal storage tanks (ST) for Oklahoma conditions
- Determine if closed-loop (no water consumption) is feasible
