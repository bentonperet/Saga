# EcoStruxure™ Reference Design 109 - EDP Impacts on UPS

**Document Number:** RD109_2.5_EDP-Impacts_EN
**Revision:** 1

## Overview

AI racks' power profile can be very peaky due to graphics processing units (GPUs), where the power peak is significantly more than the rated nominal capacity of the rack but for a very short duration – called **electrical design point (EDP) peaks**.

### Power Peak Propagation
While a portion of the power peaks are addressed by rack's power supply units and their bulk capacitance, the remainder – called **Rack Peak Power** – will propagate up through the AC line cord to:
- Power distribution system
- Uninterruptible power supply (UPS) units
- Electric grid or generator

### Impact on UPS & Batteries
- Power peaks can occur **several times per second** (depends on AI workload)
- UPSs have high overload capacity
- At higher overload levels, UPS draws power from batteries to "make up" for input stage power limits
- This can **shorten the lifetime of UPS batteries**

## Galaxy VX UPS Overload Behavior

RD109 uses **Galaxy VX 1500 kW UPS** with the following overload characteristics:

| Load Zone | Peak Load Level (T₀ = 100ms) | UPS Operating Mode - eConversion | UPS Operating Mode - Double Conversion | UPS Operating Mode - On Battery | Recommended Battery Technology |
|-----------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Level 0** | 0% … 100% | No limitations | No limitations | All peak load levels supported with energy supplied by battery | Li-Ion or VRLA |
| **Level 1** | 100% … 110% | Changes automatically to double conversion | Peak support and **no use of batteries** | ↑ | Li-Ion or VRLA |
| **Level 2** | 111% … 123% | ↑ | Peak support with **incidental use of batteries** to manage internal dynamics | ↑ | Li-Ion |
| **Level 3** | 124% … 150% | ↑ | Peak support and **operationally use the battery** to "make up" for PFC input stage power limit capped at 123%. Above 150% peak is on the limit of transferring to bypass operation | ↑ | Li-Ion |

## Design Guideline for AI Applications

**Key Recommendation:**
When the UPS is loaded up to **123% of its capacity** in double conversion mode, it manages the overload for up to 100ms with only **incidental use of batteries**. This leads to **minimal to no impact** on expected battery lifetime.

**Sizing Rule:**
> When using Galaxy VX UPS in AI applications, size the UPS such that maximum load is **≤ 123% of capacity**, even at N redundancy and worst-case assumption that all AI racks experience power peaks simultaneously.

## RD109 Design Assumptions

### IT Load Composition
- **48× Nvidia GB200 NVL72 racks** (AI workload)
- **48× Support racks** (network/storage)

### Design Parameters

| Assumption | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Nvidia GB200 NVL72 Rack Peak Power** | 173.4 kVA |
| **Total # of Nvidia NVL72 racks** | 48 racks |
| **Support rack power consumption** | 22 kW |
| (assume power factor of 0.95) | 7.23 kVAR |
| | 23.16 kVA |
| **Total # of support racks** | 48 racks |
| **Wire losses** | 1% |
| **PDU losses** | 2.045 kW (core loss) |
| | 20.732 kW (load loss) |

**Note:** Power factor of 0.95 for support racks is a **conservative assumption** – realistically would be closer to 0.98 or 1.0.

## Peak Load Calculations

### Normal Operation (4-makes-3 Configuration)
- **Total peak power consumption on UPS:** 9,686 kVA
- **Total UPS capacity:** 12,000 kVA
- **% of UPS capacity:** **81%** ✅

### With Single Powertrain Failure (N Redundancy)
- **Total peak power consumption:** 9,728 kVA
- **Total UPS capacity:** 9,000 kVA
- **% of UPS capacity:** **108%** ✅

---

## Design Validation

✅ **RD109 Properly Sized for EDP Peaks**

Even with:
- Single powertrain failure
- Worst-case low power factor assumptions (0.95) for support racks
- **ALL** Nvidia NVL72 racks hitting rack peak power **simultaneously**

The Galaxy VX UPS is **never loaded higher than 108%**.

This is **below the recommended limit of 123%**, ensuring:
- Minimal battery usage during peaks
- No impact on battery lifetime
- Proper handling of AI workload power characteristics

## Key Insights for Saga Project

### Relevance to Saga Pryor DC
While RD109 is designed for **Nvidia GB200 NVL72** racks with specific peak power characteristics (173.4 kVA), the Saga project needs to:

1. **Determine actual AI rack specifications** from prospective customers
2. **Calculate rack peak power** for the specific GPU/AI hardware to be deployed
3. **Verify UPS loading** stays within 123% limit under N redundancy
4. **Consider BESS-as-UPS strategy** and how it handles peak loads differently

### UPS Capacity Utilization
- Normal operation: **81% loaded** (good headroom)
- N failure: **108% loaded** (within safe limits, minimal battery draw)
- Design limit: **123% maximum** (to avoid battery lifetime degradation)
