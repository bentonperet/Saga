## Relevance to Saga Pryor DC

### Key Questions from Feasibility Memo

1. **Line 71: "Do we include CDUs now?"**
   - RD109 includes **9× CDUs** pre-installed
   - Each CDU serves ~5 AI racks
   - Adds upfront cost but accelerates AI customer deployment

2. **OCP Compliance (Line 64):**
   - AI racks are **OCP Open Architecture MGX** design
   - Uses OCP V3 rack busbars and 50VDC power shelves
   - Designed for hyperscale AI workloads (e.g., Nvidia GB200 NVL72)

3. **Fan Walls vs. RDHx (Line 75):**
   - RD109 uses **6× fan walls** for air-cooled network racks
   - Feasibility Memo recommends evaluating **rear-door heat exchangers (RDHx)** instead
   - RDHx provides per-rack cooling flexibility for varied customer densities

### Saga Design Decisions

**If following RD109 baseline:**
- Pre-install CDUs for liquid cooling capability
- Use OCP-compliant racks for AI workloads
- Consider swapping fan walls for RDHx (per Erik's recommendation)

**Deployment flexibility:**
- Can deploy racks incrementally as customers sign
- Power shelves and CDUs can be added per customer requirements
- Hybrid air/liquid cooling supports diverse workload types
