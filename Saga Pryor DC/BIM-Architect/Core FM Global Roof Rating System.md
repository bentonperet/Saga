## **1\. Core FM Global Roof Rating System**

FM Global ratings are not simply for individual products but for the **entire roofing assembly**â€”from the roof deck up to the top membrane. The rating is expressed as **"Class X-YYY"** where:

| Component | Rating Standard | Description |
| ----- | :---: | :---: |
| **X (Fire Resistance)** | Class 1 (Almost always (Almost always 1\) | Denotes that the assembly is a "Class 1" fire-rated system when tested from below the deck (i.e., it will not readily contribute to a fire inside the building). |
| **YYY (Wind Uplift)** | Uplift Capacity in psf (e.g., 60,90,150) | Represents the maximum sustained negative pressure (uplift force) that the complete roof assembly can withstand when tested according to FM 4474\. The number (60 to 360\) is the rating in pounds per square foot (psf), not wind speed. |
