###  Risk Factors

**Location-Specific Risks:**
- ✓ Pryor, Oklahoma is in **FM Global's designated tornado region**
- ✓ ASCE 7-22 design tornado wind speed: **140+ mph**
- ✓ High frequency of severe thunderstorms and hail
- ✓ Annual tornado probability: 1-2% for EF2+ within 25 miles

**Facility-Specific Risks:**
- ✓ 24/7/365 operations (high business interruption exposure)
- ✓ Mission-critical infrastructure (revenue impact from downtime)
- ✓ High-value electronic equipment concentration
- ✓ Potential rooftop equipment (generators, cooling towers, BESS)

## Roof Design Options for Quote Comparison
We are evaluating **three roof design scenarios** with different wind resistance and construction standards. Please provide separate quotes for each option.

### Option 1: Conventional Steel Deck Design (BASELINE)
**Risk Profile:** Standard commercial construction, code-minimum compliance

#### Roof System Specifications

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Roof Deck** | 22-gauge steel deck |
| **Deck Attachment** | Standard screw pattern per ASCE 7-16 |
| **Insulation** | Polyisocyanurate, R-30 minimum |
| **Membrane** | 60-mil TPO or PVC, mechanically attached |
| **Wind Uplift Rating** | 90-120 psf (code minimum) |
| **FM Global Rating** | NOT FM Approved |
| **Fire Rating** | Class A fire-rated assembly |
| **ASCE 7-16 Compliance** | Yes (code minimum) |
| **FM Tornado Compliance** | **No** |

#### Insurance Considerations
- Does NOT meet FM Global Data Sheet 1-28 tornado requirements
- Standard commercial property insurance rates apply
- May require **wind/tornado exclusions or limitations**
- Higher deductibles likely for wind-related claims

**Quote Request:**
- Annual property insurance premium
- Coverage limitations or exclusions (especially tornado/wind)
- Deductible amounts (wind vs. other perils)
- Business interruption coverage terms
- Estimated claim response time


### Option 2: Enhanced Steel Deck Design (FM COMPLIANT)
**Risk Profile:** Enhanced construction, FM Global tornado-compliant

#### Roof System Specifications

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Roof Deck** | 20-gauge steel deck (enhanced) |
| **Deck Attachment** | Enhanced fastening pattern (per FM 1-28) |
| **Joist Spacing** | Reduced spacing for shorter deck spans |
| **Insulation** | FM Approved, mechanically attached per zones |
| **Membrane** | FM Approved, fully adhered or enhanced mechanical |
| **Wind Uplift Rating** | **Class 1-150** (150 psf minimum) |

| **Fire Rating** | Class 1 fire-rated assembly |
| **ASCE 7-16 Compliance** | Yes (exceeds code) |
| **FM Tornado Compliance** | **Yes** (FM Data Sheet 1-28) |

#### Insurance Considerations
- Meets FM Global Data Sheet 1-28 tornado requirements
- Steel deck acceptable to FM (but not preferred)
- Qualifies for FM Global loss prevention credits
- Broader wind/tornado coverage expected

**Quote Request:**
- Annual property insurance premium

- FM Global membership credit eligibility


### Option 3: Concrete Deck Design (PREFERRED)
**Risk Profile:** Premium construction, FM Global's preferred solution

#### Roof System Specifications

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|--------------|

| **Deck Type** | Cast-in-place or precast concrete plank |
| **Insulation** | FM Approved, mechanically attached to concrete |
| **Membrane** | FM Approved, fully adhered or mechanical |
| **Wind Uplift Rating** | **Class 1-150 to Class 1-180** |
| **FM Global Rating** | **FM Approved Assembly (Preferred)** |
| **Fire Rating** | Class 1 fire-rated assembly |
| **ASCE 7-16 Compliance** | Yes (significantly exceeds code) |
| **FM Tornado Compliance** | **Yes (Preferred by FM Global)** |
| **Missile Impact Resistance** | Excellent (superior to steel) |

#### Insurance Considerations
- **FM Global's preferred roof deck type** (best loss history)
- Exceeds FM Global Data Sheet 1-28 tornado requirements
- Maximum loss prevention credits expected
- Superior missile impact and fire resistance
- 50+ year service life (vs 20-25 for steel)

**Quote Request:**
- Annual property insurance premium
- Premium reduction vs. Option 1 ($ and %)
- Premium reduction vs. Option 2 ($ and %)
- Coverage improvements vs. Options 1 and 2
- Lowest available deductibles
- Expedited claims processing benefits
- FM Global membership credit eligibility
- Any special recognition for concrete deck preference
