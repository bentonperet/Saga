## Additional Financial Considerations

### 1. Insurance Coverage Improvements

Beyond premium reductions, FM compliance may provide:
- **Broader coverage** (tornado damage explicitly covered)
- **Lower deductibles** (potentially $50K-$100K reduction)
- **Faster claims processing** (FM-engineered facilities)
- **Business interruption benefits** (reduced downtime risk)

**Estimated value:** $10K-$25K/year in risk reduction

---

### 2. Avoided Loss Scenarios

**Tornado/Severe Wind Event:**
- Baseline roof failure: $5M-$15M in damage + downtime
- FM-compliant roof: Minimal damage, maintained operations
- **Risk reduction value:** Difficult to quantify but substantial

**Statistical tornado risk in Oklahoma:**
- Annual probability: ~1-2% for EF2+ tornado within 25 miles
- 20-year probability: ~33% of experiencing damaging event

---

### 3. Asset Life and Maintenance

| Roof Type | Expected Life | Maintenance Cost/Year | Lifecycle Cost (20yr) |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Steel Deck** | 20-25 years | $5,000-$10,000 | $100,000-$200,000 |
| **Concrete Deck** | 50+ years | $3,000-$6,000 | $60,000-$120,000 |

**Concrete deck additional benefits:**
- Longer service life (50+ vs 20-25 years)
- Lower maintenance costs
- **Lifecycle savings: $40K-$80K over 20 years**

---

### 4. Roof Load Capacity

**Concrete deck advantage:**
- Supports heavy rooftop equipment (cooling towers, generators, BESS)
- May eliminate need for structural reinforcement: **$50K-$150K savings**
- Greater flexibility for future equipment additions

---

### 5. Financing Considerations

**Insurance Premium Financing:**
- Annual savings can offset debt service on upgrade
- At 6% interest, 5-year loan:
  - Enhanced steel: $125K loan = $30K/year payment (covered by savings)
  - Concrete deck: $275K loan = $65K/year payment (potentially covered)

**Net cash flow impact: Neutral to positive from Year 1**

---

## Risk-Adjusted Analysis

### Probability-Weighted Scenarios

Assuming:
- 40% probability: Conservative scenario
- 40% probability: Mid-range scenario
- 20% probability: Optimistic scenario

**Expected Annual Savings:**

| Roof System | Weighted Average Savings |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| **Enhanced Steel** | $56,250 |
| **Concrete Deck** | $90,000 |

**Expected Payback:**
