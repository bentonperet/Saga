- **AutoCAD** — clean & prep Schneider DWG details (PURGE, AUDIT, explode blocks as needed).
- **Revit (single author / one hybrid role)** — create LOD200 architectural model / massing, set levels/grids, and place simplified equipment footprints (generic families). This is the primary file the next architect will pick up.
- **Enscape / Twinmotion / simple renderer** — quick investor-grade renders from the Revit model (if your BIM Architect can use it).
- **IFC export** from Revit (IFC4) — produces a neutral model the next architect or reviewers can open in many viewers.
- **Free IFC viewer** (BIM Vision, Solibri viewer, or similar) — to spot-check exported IFCs without buying Navisworks.
    
- **Simple coordination tracker** (spreadsheet, Airtable, or your PM tool) — to log issues, owners, and actions.
    

# Lightweight workflow for your 4-person team (exact steps)

1. **CAD prep (owner / CAD tech)**
    
    - Clean Schneider DWGs: purge, flatten Z, remove non-geometry annotation, fix units.
        
    - Deliver a single clean DWG set + LandXML (if available) to the Revit author.
        
2. **Revit massing & footprints (BIM Architect / hybrid role)**
    
    - Link the cleaned DWG into Revit (Link CAD, don’t import).
        
    - Set shared origin and Levels/Grids. Document origin in README.
        
    - Model massing, simple walls, datahall layout (rack placeholders), and major equipment footprints (genset, switchgear, battery yard) as generic families.
        
    - Create 2 camera views for renders; export images + camera settings.
        
3. **Discipline inputs (Electrical / MEP / Ops leads)**
    
    - Provide 2D footprints, conceptual single-line, and “keep-out” zones as simple DWG or CSV (footprint LxW, clearance).
        
    - The Revit author places those footprint placeholders into the model.
        
4. **Light coordination & checks (weekly)**
    
    - Run manual clearance checks in Revit (section views, clash-like checks) or visually inspect overlays in the viewer.
        
    - Log conflicts into the tracker and resolve by adjusting placeholders/adjacencies. No Navisworks required unless clashes are complex.
        
5. **IFC export & quick QA**
    
    - Export IFC4 from Revit, open in a free IFC viewer to confirm geometry, levels, and property presence. Save screenshots for handoff.
        
6. **Deliverables & handoff**
    
    - Provide: .rvt (LOD200), IFC, PDFs (plans/elevations), 2 renders (PNG) + Assumptions CSV + README_COORDINATES.md. That’s the clean package your future architect needs.
        

# When you _should_ bring in Navisworks / full BEP — concrete triggers

Start Navisworks and a fuller BEP when **any** of these conditions apply:

- **>2 discipline Revit models** exist and you need automated clash detection between them.
    
- You’re moving to **LOD300+ (permit level)** or the work requires precise routing (busways, tray runs) that must be validated early.
    
- Client or contractor **requires** a formal clash log for procurement or to validate long-lead spatial conflicts.
    
- You begin concurrent authoring (multiple people editing the same workshare project) and need formal publish/federation cadence.
    
- You’re scheduling **4D sequences / cost-linked 5D workflows** for construction phasing or investor level-of-effort proof.
    

# Practical threshold examples

- If MEP runs occupy more than ~10% of the white space floor-area or you need to validate multiple busways & overhead trays → run Navisworks.
    
- If you have full Revit MEP + Electrical models from subcontractors → run weekly Navisworks clash runs.
    
- If you want to hand an IFC to the Architect and **guarantee < 5 critical spatial conflicts**, consider at least one Navisworks/Clash run or hire a 4–8 hour federation check.
    

# Cost/risk tradeoff — simple guidance

- **No Navisworks now** = lower immediate cost, faster investor visuals, slightly higher risk that the future architect will find spatial issues (which is normal and expected). Mitigate with good assumptions and clear placeholders.
- **Buy/subscribe Navisworks early** = more upfront time & license cost but lower risk for late surprises. Good if you expect aggressive MEP density or want to show a “clash-cleared” model to investors.
    

# Short checklist to “future-proof” today’s work (do these now so an architect can pick up easily)

- Clean DWGs & LandXML ready.
- Revit LOD200 with Levels/Grids + README origin.
- Placeholders for all major electrical/MEP equipment (generic families, flagged as `PLACEHOLDER`).
- Assumptions CSV with all numeric values and confidence levels.
- IFC4 export that opens in a viewer (screenshot proof).
- Mini-BEP one-pager (we already have one) included in handoff.
- One 30–45 min onboarding call scheduled with the incoming Architect.

# Final recommendation (one line)

Proceed now with the **minimal Revit + IFC + renderer** workflow and the Mini-BEP; **only buy/run Navisworks** when you hit the concrete triggers above (multiple discipline Revit models, LOD300 push, or real clash risk). That keeps the sprint fast, cheap, and investor-focused — while leaving a clean, testable path into full coordination later.

If you want, I will:
- Produce a 1-page “Navisworks Trigger Checklist” you can pin to the Mini-BEP (so everyone knows exactly when to flip the switch), and
- Convert the “future-proof” checklist above into a one-page handoff the architect can sign-off on.



# Why you can delay Navisworks / full BEP

- This phase is **conceptual / BoD / LOD200**: the goal is to prove fit, quantify white-space, and create investor visuals — not to resolve every system clash at permit quality.
    
- Navisworks shines when you’re **federating multiple, fully-authored discipline Revit models** and need automated clash detection. If you only have: one Revit architectural model (or massing), plus DWG reference blocks from Schneider, and a small MEP/electrical concept, you can coordinate without a full Navisworks workflow.
    
- A big, prescriptive BEP is most valuable when many firms and exchanges are happening. For now, a **Mini-BEP** (what we already built) + clear handoff items is sufficient.
