No — a separate full-time **BIM Manager** isn’t strictly required for this 4-person, LOD200/BoD sprint. **What matters is that the BIM-manager responsibilities are explicitly owned** by a named person. If those tasks are **not** owned, coordination friction and rework will eat the schedule.

---
# Why (quick logic)

- This phase is early (LOD200): lightweight coordination, placeholders, renders, IFC export — not deep multi-discipline routing.
- Navisworks / heavy BEP value appears only once multiple full Revit discipline models exist.
- A small, senior hybrid (BIM Architect who also runs BIM Lead tasks) can deliver high value if they have time & the right checklist.
- But somebody still needs to do the technical BIM chores — that’s the whole point of the “BIM Manager” role. It’s the _function_, not always a separate hire.

# Practical options (pick one)

1. **Hybrid (recommended for cost & speed)**
    - **Who:** BIM Architect (senior) takes on BIM Lead tasks.
    - **You (PM):** run schedule, client reviews, and remove blockers.
    - **When to use:** small team, clean DWGs, renders critical, and candidate is proven.
    - **Budget/time:** 20–30 hrs/week for the hybrid role (or 15–20 if you accept risk).
    - **Pros:** minimal hires, faster decisions.
    - **Cons:** single-person bottleneck; risk if they overbook.
        
2. **Split duties (low-risk, minimal hire)**
    - **Who:** BIM Architect = modeling & renders; you or Electrical/MEP lead = lightweight BIM coordination (shared coords + weekly publish); hire a 8–16 hr contractor for final IFC QA/federation if needed.
    - **When to use:** you can coordinate but want someone else to run export/QA.
    - **Budget/time:** hybrid + one small contractor burst.
    - **Pros:** reduces overload, keeps specialist checks cheap.
    - **Cons:** extra coordination overhead.
    
3. **Hire dedicated short-term BIM Manager**
    - **Who:** separate BIM Lead (contract, 6–12 weeks).
    - **When to use:** messy CAD, high MEP density, or you lack a senior Revit author. 
    - **Budget/time:** full role (20–40 hrs/wk).
    - **Pros:** lowest rework risk.
    - **Cons:** higher cost, more to hire quickly.

# Essential BIM-Manager tasks you _must_ cover (delegate these now)

If you choose hybrid/split, make sure someone owns each item below:

- **Shared coordinates & Levels/Grids** — critical for future handoff.
- **Mini-BEP enforcement** — file naming, worksets (VISUAL/COORD/ARCH/MEP).
- **IFC4 export & QA** — export and open in a free viewer; screenshot proof.
- **Assumptions CSV & Equipment Schedule** — numeric source of truth.
- **Final handoff package** (.rvt, .ifc, .nwc or snapshot, PDFs, renders, README).
- **Weekly publish cadence & one weekly model check** — not full clash runs, just clearance checks.
- **Render production + camera settings export** (if BIM Architect doing viz).
- **Single point of contact for incoming Architect onboarding call.**

Map those to who on your 4-person team will own them now.

# Triggers that _will force_ a dedicated BIM Manager

(If any of these happen, hire or contract one immediately.)
- Multiple discipline Revit models (>2) authored concurrently.
- Move to LOD300 / permit work.
- Need for automated clash runs and formal clash log for procurement.
- Unclean DWGs/complex civil integrations or point-clouds.

---

# Suggested immediate next steps (actionable, do this this week)

1. Pick who will be the hybrid owner (BIM Architect or you). Write it into the project roster.
2. Assign the 8 essential tasks above across the team (one-line owner for each).
3. Block a 60-minute kickoff: open the Revit seed file + cleaned DWG, confirm shared origin, levels, and a short publish schedule.
4. Run one test: export IFC4 and open in BIM Vision; save screenshots. If it fails, hire a 4–8 hr contractor to fix.
5. Add a SOW line clarifying that LOD300/permitting is out of scope and will trigger additional staffing.

# One-sentence recommendation

For this sprint: **don’t hire a separate BIM Manager unless you need to — but do name an explicit BIM owner (preferably the BIM Architect) and back them with a small burst of contractor hours for IFC QA or Navisworks federation if anything looks messy.**

Would you like me to:

- Draft the _one-paragraph SOW addition_ that assigns BIM responsibilities and the trigger for hiring a BIM Manager, **and**
    
- Produce the 1-page task owner table (who owns each essential BIM task) ready to paste into your project roster?
