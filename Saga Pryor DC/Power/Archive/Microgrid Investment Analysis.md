# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This analysis evaluates expanding the solar capacity of a grid-independent microgrid from the baseline 5 MW DC configuration to either 8 MW or 10 MW. The expanded systems significantly increase renewable energy penetration while reducing natural gas consumption and emissions.

## Key Findings

- 8 MW Solar increases renewable fraction from 21.7% to 37.6% (+74% improvement)
    
- 10 MW Solar achieves 44.5% renewable fraction (+105% improvement)
    
- Both configurations maintain 100% system reliability with zero unserved energy
    
- LCOE increases are moderate: +4.7% for 8 MW, +7.7% for 10 MW (with 28 MWh BESS)
    
- Annual CO₂ emissions reduced by 1,618-2,725 tons compared to baseline
    

## Recommendation

RECOMMENDED: 8 MW Solar with 28 MWh BESS

This configuration offers the best balance of performance and cost:

- Additional CAPEX: +$3.74M (19% over baseline)
    
- LCOE increase: Only 4.7% (from $0.186 to $0.195/kWh)
    
- Renewable energy: 37.6% (nearly double the baseline)
    
- Annual fuel savings: $107k at current gas prices
    
- CO₂ reduction: 1,618 tons/year (16% reduction)

# RECOMMENDATIONS & DECISION FRAMEWORK

## Scenario 1: 8 MW Solar with 28 MWh BESS (RECOMMENDED)

Best for: Organizations prioritizing sustainability without extreme cost increases

Advantages:

- Moderate CAPEX increase: +$3.74M (19% over baseline)
    
- LCOE increases only 4.7% (from $0.186 to $0.195/kWh)
    
- Renewable fraction jumps from 21.7% to 37.6% (+74% improvement)
    
- Saves 30,519 MMBtu fuel/year = $107k/year
    
- Reduces CO₂ emissions by 1,618 tons/year (16% reduction)
    
- BESS cycles moderately at 29.7 cycles/year (manageable for standard warranties)
    

Considerations:

- Battery cycling is higher than baseline but within acceptable range
    
- Simple payback on fuel savings alone: ~35 years (improves if gas prices rise)
    

## Scenario 2: 10 MW Solar with 28 MWh BESS

Best for: Maximum renewable energy on limited budget

Advantages:

- Highest renewable fraction: 44.5% (+105% over baseline)
    
- Turbine usage reduced to 71.9% of year (major operational improvement)
    
- Saves 51,420 MMBtu fuel/year = $180k/year
    
- Reduces CO₂ emissions by 2,725 tons/year (26% reduction)
    
- Moderate CAPEX increase: +$6.24M (32% over baseline)
    

Considerations:

- CRITICAL: Battery cycles heavily at 37 cycles/year - may reduce battery life to 8-9 years instead of standard 12 years
    
- LCOE increase of 7.7% is still moderate and may be acceptable for sustainability goals
    

## Scenario 3: 8 MW Solar with 40 MWh BESS

Best for: Conservative approach prioritizing battery longevity

Advantages:

- Similar performance to 8 MW/28 MWh but with lighter cycling (20.9 vs 29.7 cycles/year)
    
- Extends BESS life to standard 12-year replacement cycle
    
- Same renewable fraction: 37.6%
    

  

Considerations:

- Higher CAPEX: +$7.02M (36% over baseline)
    
- LCOE increases 19.8% (from $0.186 to $0.223/kWh)
    
- May not justify the additional battery investment for similar operational results
    

## Scenario 4: 10 MW Solar with 50 MWh BESS

Best for: Organizations with deep commitment to decarbonization and capital available

Advantages:

- Highest renewable fraction: 44.6%
    
- Lowest turbine usage: only 71.9% of year
    
- Optimal battery cycling: 20.9 cycles/year (standard warranty expectations)
    
- Best long-term sustainability profile
    

Considerations:

- Highest CAPEX: +$12.25M (63% over baseline)
    
- LCOE increases 34.9% (from $0.186 to $0.251/kWh)
    
- Significant premium for marginal renewable improvement over 10 MW/28 MWh option
    

# COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS

## Economic Metrics

|Configuration|AdditionalCAPEX|RenewableImprovement|Cost per %Renewable|Annual FuelSavings|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|8 MW (28 MWh BESS)|+$3.74M|+15.9 pp|$235k|$107k/yr|
|10 MW (28 MWh BESS)|+$6.24M|+22.8 pp|$274k|$180k/yr|
|8 MW (40 MWh BESS)|+$7.02M|+15.9 pp|$442k|$107k/yr|
|10 MW (50 MWh BESS)|+$12.25M|+22.9 pp|$535k|$180k/yr|

pp = percentage points. Fuel savings at $3.50/MMBtu natural gas price.

## Key Economic Insights

- Simple CAPEX payback on fuel savings alone: 35 years for all scenarios
    
- If natural gas prices increase to $5-6/MMBtu (historical highs), payback drops to 20-25 years
    
- Each percentage point of renewable improvement costs $235k-$535k in additional CAPEX
    
- 8 MW configurations offer best value per percentage point of renewable improvement
    
- Carbon pricing or renewable energy mandates could significantly improve economics
    

# IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS

## Battery Life & Replacement

Battery cycling is a critical consideration for long-term operational success:

- Baseline (5 MW): 2.8 cycles/year - excellent for battery longevity
    
- 8 MW (28 MWh): 29.7 cycles/year - moderate, within most warranty ranges
    
- 10 MW (28 MWh): 37 cycles/year - heavy cycling, may require replacement at 9 years
    
- 8 MW (40 MWh) or 10 MW (50 MWh): 20.9 cycles/year - optimal for 12-year life
    

Standard BESS warranties guarantee 10-12 years or 4,000-6,000 cycles, whichever comes first. The 10 MW/28 MWh configuration may hit cycle limits before time limits.

## Sensitivity to Natural Gas Prices

Project economics are moderately sensitive to natural gas prices. Current assumption: $3.50/MMBtu

|Gas Price|Annual Savings<br><br>(8 MW Config)|% of Base Case|Simple Payback|
|---|---|---|---|
|$2.50/MMBtu|$35k|31%|40+ years|
|$3.50/MMBtu (Base)|$107k|100%|35 years|
|$5.00/MMBtu|$180k|168%|21 years|
|$6.50/MMBtu|$252k|236%|15 years|

## Risk Factors

- Natural gas price volatility: Historical range $2-8/MMBtu affects operating costs
    
- Battery degradation: Heavy cycling in 10 MW/28 MWh may require earlier replacement
    
- ITC policy changes: 30% credit may sunset or change after 2032
    
- Technology costs declining: Solar/BESS costs dropping 2-15%/year
    
- Regulatory: Potential future carbon pricing would favor higher solar configurations
    

# FINAL RECOMMENDATION

PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION: 8 MW Solar with 28 MWh BESS

This configuration offers the optimal balance of renewable performance, cost, and operational simplicity for most data center applications.

## Implementation Roadmap

1. Phase 1 (Months 1-6): Development & Engineering
    

Site design, permitting, interconnection studies (if hybrid), environmental assessments

2. Phase 2 (Months 7-10): Procurement
    

Equipment orders (long-lead items: solar modules, BESS, turbine)

3. Phase 3 (Months 11-18): Construction
    

Civil works, equipment installation, electrical integration

4. Phase 4 (Months 19-20): Commissioning
    

Testing, validation, operator training, performance verification

5. Phase 5 (Month 21+): Commercial Operation
    

Full microgrid operation, ongoing O&M, performance monitoring

## Alternative Strategies

- Consider 10 MW/28 MWh if: Sustainability is paramount and you can accept heavier battery cycling with potential 9-year replacement
    
- Consider 10 MW/50 MWh if: Budget allows $31.6M net CAPEX and long-term decarbonization justifies premium
    
- Consider waiting 2-3 years if: Cost reduction from declining BESS prices (10-15%/year) outweighs immediate implementation benefits
    
- Consider hybrid grid-connected approach if: Complete independence is not required - maintains grid backup while achieving similar renewable fraction
    

## Success Criteria

The project should proceed if the following conditions are met:

- Organization can allocate $23-26M net CAPEX (after 30% ITC)
    
- Annual O&M budget of $1.5-1.6M is feasible
    
- Energy cost premium of 60-70% over utility rates is acceptable
    
- Energy independence and/or sustainability goals justify the investment
    
- Data center downtime costs exceed $300k/hour (making resilience valuable)
    
- Organization has technical capability to operate complex microgrid systems
