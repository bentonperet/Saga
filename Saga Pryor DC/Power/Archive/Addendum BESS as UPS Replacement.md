# Data Center Savings by Eliminating UPS Requirement

Based on our research of data center construction costs and electrical infrastructure, we’ve provided a detailed analysis of the UPS cost savings by leveraging the microgrid (BESS) to support load transfers to generator.

## Traditional N+1 UPS System Costs for 2 MW Data Center

Industry data shows that data center electrical systems (including UPS, generators, batteries, PDU, and switchgear) typically cost between 40-45% of total development costs, and overall data center construction costs range from $7-12 million per MW of IT load.

Based on 2 MW of initial data center capacity constructed with traditional N+1 UPS:

### Component Breakdown:

1. UPS Equipment (N+1 Configuration)

- For 2 MW IT load with N+1, you need ~3 MW total UPS capacity (6 x 500 kVA or 3 x 1 MW modules)
    
- Large-scale UPS systems requiring 100-500 kVA or more range from $50,000 to $250,000+ per unit, while industrial three-phase systems can cost substantially more
    
- Estimated cost: $1.5M - $2.5M for UPS modules
    

2. Battery Systems (VRLA or Lithium-ion)

- Typical 10-15 minutes runtime at 2 MW load
    
- Battery cabinets and infrastructure
    
- Estimated cost: $800k - $1.5M
    

3. Switchgear & Power Distribution

- Automatic Transfer Switches (ATS)
    
- Power Distribution Units (PDUs)
    
- Low voltage switchgear
    
- Estimated cost: $500k - $800k
    

4. Installation, Integration & Testing

- Electrical installation labor
    
- System integration and commissioning
    
- Estimated cost: $400k - $600k
    

5. Ongoing Costs (Avoided Annually)

- UPS maintenance contracts: $100k-150k/year
    
- Battery replacement (every 5-6 years VRLA, 10-12 years lithium): $200k-400k per cycle
    
- Energy losses from UPS inefficiency (8-12%): ~$50k-80k/year
    

## Total Traditional UPS System Costs:

Initial CAPEX: $3.2M - $5.4M

10-Year Total Cost of Ownership: $4.5M - $7.5M (including maintenance, battery replacements, and efficiency losses)

## Your Microgrid Approach Savings

Your microgrid system eliminates the need for traditional UPS because:

1. BESS functions as the UPS - The 28 MWh battery system provides far superior backup (10+ hours vs. 10-15 minutes)
    
2. No separate UPS infrastructure needed - The microgrid controller and inverters handle power conditioning
    
3. Turbine provides extended backup - Beyond what any UPS battery could provide
    

### Direct Savings:

- Initial CAPEX saved: $3.2M - $5.4M
    
- 10-year maintenance/replacement avoided: $1.3M - $2.1M
    
- UPS efficiency losses avoided: $500k - $800k over 10 years
    

### Net Savings Analysis:

Comparing to your corrected microgrid cost of $28.43M:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Item|Cost|
|Microgrid system (8 MW solar + 28 MWh BESS + Tier III)|$28.43M|
|LESS: Traditional UPS system you're avoiding|-$3.2M to -$5.4M|
|Effective microgrid cost (net of UPS savings)|$23.0M - $25.2M|

## Key Insights:

1. You're saving $3.2M - $5.4M in UPS CAPEX alone by using your BESS as the UPS system
    
2. Your BESS is vastly superior to traditional UPS:
    

- Traditional UPS: 10-15 minutes runtime
    
- Your BESS: 10+ hours runtime
    
- Traditional UPS: Requires separate generator backup
    
- Your BESS: Integrated with solar and turbine
    

4. Additional operational savings:
    

- No UPS maintenance contracts ($100k-150k/year)
    
- No battery replacement cycles every 5-6 years ($200k-400k each)
    
- No UPS efficiency losses (8-12% energy waste)
    

6. The corrected $28.43M microgrid investment is actually only $23-25M more expensive than it would cost with traditional UPS - and you get energy independence, sustainability, and far superior backup power
    

## Bottom Line:

You're saving approximately $3.2M - $5.4M in initial costs plus $1.8M - $2.9M over 10 years by eliminating traditional UPS systems - a total savings of $5M - $8.3M that should be factored into your microgrid investment decision.

Your microgrid's BESS essentially gives you a "free" enterprise-grade UPS system that's 40-60 times better than what a traditional data center would have!
