## 1. TECHNICAL VALIDATION

### 1.1 Why Traditional UPS is Redundant

Modern grid-forming BESS inverters perform ALL traditional UPS functions:

| UPS Function                | Traditional UPS | Grid-Forming BESS               | Notes |
| --------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------- | ----- |
| **Voltage regulation**      | ¬±1%             | ‚úÖ ¬±1%                           | Meets ANSI C84.1 |
| **Frequency regulation**    | ¬±0.1 Hz         | ‚úÖ ¬±0.1 Hz                       | Meets IEEE 1547 |
| **Response time**           | 0-4ms           | ‚úÖ <50ms (within ITIC curve)     | Acceptable for IT equipment |
| **Harmonic distortion**     | <3% THD         | ‚úÖ <5% THD (IEEE 519 compliant)  | Meets data center standards |
| **Power factor correction** | 0.99            | ‚úÖ Active/reactive power control | Full PFC capability |
| **Backup duration**         | 5-15 minutes    | ‚úÖ 3.3-3.9 hours                 | 13-16√ó longer than UPS |
| **Seamless transition**     | 0ms (online)    | ‚úÖ 0ms (grid-forming mode)       | Always supplying power |

**Critical Insight:** Grid-forming BESS operates in "online" mode continuously - it IS the power source, not a backup. There is no "transfer time" because the BESS is always supplying power through its inverters.

**Comparison to Traditional Architecture:**
- **Traditional:** Utility ‚Üí Transformer ‚Üí UPS ‚Üí Critical Load (UPS on 24/7, 5-15min backup)
- **BESS-as-UPS:** Solar + Utility ‚Üí BESS ‚Üí Critical Load (BESS on 24/7, 3.3-3.9hr backup)

### 1.2 Technical Requirements for BESS-as-UPS
To eliminate traditional UPS, the BESS must include:

**‚úÖ Grid-Forming Inverters**
- Establish voltage and frequency independently (not grid-following)
- Black-start capability for complete grid independence
- Seamless islanding and resynchronization
- **Vendor Confirmation Required:** All major vendors (Tesla, Fluence, W√§rtsil√§) offer this

**‚úÖ N+1 Redundancy**
- Multiple parallel inverters (no single point of failure)
- Phase 1: 3√ó4MW inverters ‚Üí 12MW total, 8MW available (N+1)
- Phase 2: 4√ó4MW inverters ‚Üí 16MW total, 12MW available (N+1)
- Can lose any single inverter without load disruption

**‚úÖ NFPA 855 Fire Safety Compliance**
- Automatic fire suppression (12 containers): $1.8-2.4M

## 2. FACILITY LOAD ANALYSIS & BESS SIZING

### 2.1 Load Profile Validation

**Critical Design Parameter:** BESS must be sized for **worst-case load scenario**, not just nameplate IT load.

#### Base Load Calculation

**IT Load (From Feasibility Memo V3):**
- AI Racks: 48 racks √ó 132 kW = 6,336 kW
- Network Racks: 48 racks √ó 22 kW = 1,056 kW
- **Total IT Load: 7,392 kW ‚âà 7.4 MW**

**Facility Load (PUE-Dependent):**

| Scenario | IT Load | PUE | Facility Load | Notes |
|----------|---------|-----|---------------|-------|
| **Winter Base** | 7.4 MW | 1.20 | **8.88 MW** | Mild cooling, optimal conditions |
| **Annual Average** | 7.4 MW | 1.30 | **9.62 MW** | BOD design target |
| **Summer Peak** | 7.4 MW | 1.40 | **10.36 MW** | July/August, full cooling load |
| **Design Basis** | 7.4 MW | 1.42 | **10.5 MW** | Peak + 5% margin |

**Key Insight:** Facility load varies by **1.62 MW (18%)** between winter and summer due to cooling requirements. BESS must be sized for summer peak.

#### Load Diversity Considerations
**Typical Data Center Diversity:**
- Not all racks draw peak power simultaneously
- Diversity factor: 0.7-0.85 for average load
- Peak diversity factor: 0.9-0.95 for design load

**This Analysis Assumption:**
- **Conservative approach:** No diversity credit taken
- Design to 100% peak load + 5% margin
- Justification: AI workloads are less predictable than traditional compute

#### Seasonal PUE Variation
**Oklahoma Climate Impact:**
- Summer (June-Sept): Outdoor temps 85-100¬∞F ‚Üí PUE 1.35-1.45
- Winter (Dec-Feb): Outdoor temps 30-50¬∞F ‚Üí PUE 1.15-1.25
- Spring/Fall: Moderate temps ‚Üí PUE 1.25-1.35

**Cooling System Design (From BOD Part 1):**
- Primary: Direct evaporative cooling (economizer mode)
- Backup: Mechanical refrigeration
- PUE Target: 1.2-1.3 annual average
- **Critical:** Summer peak PUE drives BESS sizing

### 2.2 BESS Power Sizing

**Design Load (Worst-Case):** 10.5 MW (7.4 MW IT √ó 1.42 PUE)

**N+1 Redundancy Requirement:**
- Required available capacity: 10.5 MW
- With N+1 (lose 1 inverter): Need 4 inverters √ó X MW each
- Solving: (4-1) √ó X = 10.5 MW ‚Üí X = 3.5 MW minimum
- **Selected: 4√ó4MW inverters** (provides 12MW available N+1)
- **Margin:** 12 MW - 10.5 MW = **1.5 MW (14% over design load)**

**Phased Deployment:**

| Deployment | Inverters | Total Capacity | Available (N+1) | Supports Load | Occupancy Trigger |
|------------|-----------|----------------|-----------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Phase 0** | 2√ó4MW | 8 MW | 4 MW | ‚â§4 MW | Day 1 (25-35%) |
| **Phase 1** | 3√ó4MW | 12 MW | 8 MW | ‚â§8 MW | ~40% occupancy (~5 MW committed) |
| **Phase 2** | 4√ó4MW | 16 MW | 12 MW | ‚â§12 MW | ~70% occupancy (~7 MW committed) |

**Phase 1 Trigger:** When facility reaches **~40% leased capacity** (~5 MW committed IT load)
**Phase 2 Trigger:** When facility reaches **~70% leased capacity** (~7 MW committed IT load)
**Margin at Full Build:** 12 MW available - 10.5 MW design load = **1.5 MW (14% over design load)**

### 2.3 BESS Energy Sizing (Phased Deployment Approach)

**Target Backup Duration:** 4+ hours at each phase's design load (maintains consistent protection as facility grows)

**Phased Battery Deployment Strategy:**

| Phase | DC Occupancy | Design Load | Inverter Capacity | Battery Capacity | Backup Duration | Cost |
|-------|--------------|-------------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|------|
| **Phase 0** | 25-35% | 4 MW | 8MW (2√ó4MW, N+1) | **16 MWh** | 4.0 hrs | $13-15M |
| **Phase 1** | 50-60% | 8 MW | 12MW (3√ó4MW, N+1) | **32 MWh** (+16) | 4.0 hrs | +$10-12M |
| **Phase 2** | 100% | 12 MW | 16MW (4√ó4MW, N+1) | **48 MWh** (+16) | 4.0 hrs | +$8-10M |

**Energy Calculation (Per Phase):**
```
Phase 0: 4 MW √ó 4.0 hr √∑ (0.85 DoD √ó 0.96 efficiency) = 19.6 MWh ‚Üí Deploy 16 MWh
Phase 1: 8 MW √ó 4.0 hr √∑ 0.816 = 39.2 MWh ‚Üí Deploy 32 MWh cumulative
Phase 2: 12 MW √ó 4.0 hr √∑ 0.816 = 58.8 MWh ‚Üí Deploy 48 MWh cumulative
```

**Actual Backup Duration (Accounting for Losses):**

| Phase | Deployed Batteries | Usable Energy | Design Load | Backup Duration | Notes |
|-------|-------------------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Phase 0** | 16 MWh | 13.1 MWh | 4 MW | **3.3 hours** | Adequate for initial occupancy |
| **Phase 1** | 32 MWh | 26.1 MWh | 8 MW | **3.3 hours** | Consistent backup as load grows |
| **Phase 2** | 48 MWh | 39.1 MWh | 12 MW | **3.3 hours** | Full occupancy, maintains backup |

**Key Findings:**
- Maintains **consistent 3.3-hour backup** at each phase's design load
- Generators can start and stabilize within 15 minutes (well under 3.3 hours)
- **Aligns CAPEX with revenue:** Deploy batteries only when tenants lease space
- **Defers $20-25M** by phasing batteries (vs. deploying all 48MWh upfront)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk: Battery prices may increase between phases (mitigation: lock pricing in Phase 0 contract)

**Why Phase Batteries (Not Deploy All Upfront)?**
1. **Cash Flow Optimization:** Avoid tying up $20M in unused batteries at 25% occupancy
2. **Revenue Alignment:** CAPEX deployment matches tenant lease-up timeline
3. **Reduced Financing Costs:** Lower debt service on smaller initial investment
4. **Technology Risk Mitigation:** Later phases benefit from battery cost declines and tech improvements
5. **Flexibility:** Can adjust Phase 1/2 sizing based on actual tenant power density

**Modular Expansion Risk Mitigation:**
- Size electrical infrastructure for full 48MWh from Day 1 (conduit, buswork, pad space)
- Pre-wire for 12 battery containers (occupy with temp barriers as needed)
- Contract option to purchase Phase 1/2 batteries at locked pricing
- Use same vendor/model across all phases (plug-and-play expansion)
- Budget 2-week commissioning window for each battery addition (vs. 3-4 months for full system)

### 2.4 BESS Specifications Summary

| Specification | Phase 0 (Day 1) | Phase 1 (Mid-Scale) | Phase 2 (Full Build) | Rationale |
|--------------|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Power Rating** | **8MW AC** | **12MW AC** | **16MW AC** | Scales with occupancy: 25% ‚Üí 50% ‚Üí 100% |

## 3. UPDATED COST ANALYSIS

### 3.1 Component Pricing (2024-2025 Market Data - Phased Deployment)

**Source:** [[Component Pricing Deep Dive - BESS vs UPS]] (validated October 2025)

**Phase 0 - Initial Deployment (25-35% Occupancy):**

| Component             | Specification           | Cost       | Confidence | Notes |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----- |
| **BESS Batteries**    | **16MWh** (4 containers) | **$8.0-8.5M** | **60%** ‚ö†Ô∏è | 2024 BESS pricing $500/kWh; **RFI needed** |
| **BESS Inverters**    | **2√ó4MW grid-forming** | **$3.0-3.5M** | **60%** ‚ö†Ô∏è | Phased deployment option |
| **NFPA 855 Fire Safety (Partial)** | 4 containers + base infrastructure | **$1.8M** | **75%** ‚úÖ | Scales with container count |
| **Generators**        | 4√ó3750kVA natural gas, tornado-rated | **$7M** | **65%** ‚ö†Ô∏è | Market data suggests $6.5-7.5M; **RFI needed** |

| **PHASE 0 TOTAL**   | Pure BESS-as-UPS | **$21.65-22.65M** | | Supports 2-3MW IT load (~25-35% occupancy) |

**Phase 1 - Mid-Scale Expansion (50-60% Occupancy):**

| Component             | Specification           | Incremental Cost | Notes |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- | ----- |
| **BESS Batteries**    | **+16MWh** (4 more containers) | **+$8.0-8.5M** | Cumulative: 32MWh |
| **BESS Inverters**    | **+1√ó4MW** (3rd inverter) | **+$1.5-1.75M** | Cumulative: 12MW (8MW N+1) |
| **NFPA 855 Fire Safety** | 4 more containers | **+$1.2M** | Cumulative: 8 containers |
| **PHASE 1 INCREMENTAL** | | **+$10.7-11.45M** | Supports 5-6MW IT load |
| **CUMULATIVE (Phase 0+1)** | | **$32.35-34.1M** | |

**Phase 2 - Full Buildout (100% Occupancy):**

| Component             | Specification           | Incremental Cost | Notes |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- | ----- |
| **BESS Batteries**    | **+16MWh** (4 more containers) | **+$8.0-8.5M** | Cumulative: 48MWh |
| **BESS Inverters**    | **+1√ó4MW** (4th inverter) | **+$1.5-1.75M** | Cumulative: 16MW (12MW N+1) |
| **NFPA 855 Fire Safety** | 4 more containers | **+$1.2M** | Cumulative: 12 containers |
| **PHASE 2 INCREMENTAL** | | **+$10.7-11.45M** | Supports 7.4MW IT load (100%) |
| **TOTAL BUILDOUT (All Phases)** | | **$43.05-45.55M** | Full 48MWh/16MW system |

**Revised vs. Traditional Comparison:**
- **Traditional Architecture:** $39.8-41.8M (UPS + BESS-for-solar only)
- **Phased BESS-as-UPS:** $43.05-45.55M total, BUT **$21.65-22.65M Phase 0** (massive cash flow advantage)
- **Net Savings:** Eliminated by phasing overhead, BUT **defers $21-23M by 12-24 months**

**Notes:**
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **60-65% Confidence Items:** BESS and Generator costs need vendor validation via RFI (target: issue by Oct 25)
2. ‚úÖ **75-85% Confidence Items:** Controls and Fire Safety costs based on Erik's addendum and industry standards
3. **BESS Pricing:** $500/kWh blended rate (conservative for 2024-2025 market, which saw 40% YoY drop)
4. **Fire Safety Scales:** $450k per 4-container batch (includes suppression, detection, HVAC)
5. **Inverter Marginal Cost:** Adding inverters is cheaper than initial deployment (already have controls, site prep)

### 3.2 Cost Comparison: Traditional vs. Phased BESS-as-UPS

#### Scenario 1: Traditional UPS + BESS for Solar (Baseline)

**Architecture:** UPS and BESS operate independently. UPS provides 5-15 min backup, generators take over. BESS only used for solar storage.

| Component | Cost | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| UPS (12.4MW) | $8-10M | Traditional Tier III system (Li-ion batteries, N+1) |
| BESS (48MWh) | $24M | For solar storage only (no UPS function) |
| Generators | $7M | Backup power (4√ó3750kVA) |
| Basic Controls | $0.8M | BESS for solar only, separate UPS controls |
| **TOTAL** | **$39.8-41.8M** | **Current baseline architecture (all deployed upfront)** |

**Backup Duration:** UPS provides 5-15 minutes ‚Üí Generators start ‚Üí BESS charges from solar

#### Scenario 2: Phased BESS-as-UPS (RECOMMENDED)

**Architecture:** BESS is the sole power conditioning and backup system. Batteries AND inverters scale with actual load growth. Generators only run for extended outages >3 hours.

| Phase | DC Occupancy | BESS Config | Phase Cost | Cumulative Cost | vs. Baseline |
|-------|--------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Phase 0** | 25-35% | 8MW/16MWh (2√ó4MW) | **$21.65-22.65M** | **$21.65-22.65M** | **-$17-20M deferred** ‚úÖ |
| **Phase 1** | 50-60% | 12MW/32MWh (3√ó4MW) | **+$10.7-11.45M** | **$32.35-34.1M** | **-$7-9M deferred** ‚úÖ |
| **Phase 2** | 100% | 16MW/48MWh (4√ó4MW) | **+$10.7-11.45M** | **$43.05-45.55M** | **+$1-4M more** ‚ö†Ô∏è |

**Key Trade-Off:**
- **Phase 0:** Saves $17-20M in upfront CAPEX (52% reduction) vs. traditional baseline
- **Phase 2 Total:** Costs $1-4M MORE than traditional ($43M vs. $40M)
- **BUT:** Defers majority of cost by 12-24 months, aligning with revenue
- **Net Present Value:** Superior due to deferred CAPEX (discount $20M deferred = ~$17M NPV benefit @ 10% discount rate)

**Why Accept Higher Total Cost?**
1. **Cash flow is king:** Starting at $22M vs. $40M enables project to launch
2. **Revenue alignment:** Deploy CAPEX only when tenants are paying rent
3. **Reduced financing costs:** Lower debt service on smaller initial investment
4. **Flexibility:** Can adjust Phase 1/2 timing based on actual lease-up
5. **Technology benefit:** Later phases benefit from continued battery cost declines

**Backup Duration:** 3.3 hours @ each phase's design load (consistent protection) ‚Üí Generators for >3hr outages

**Operational Advantages vs. Traditional:**
- No UPS maintenance, battery replacement ($445k/year savings)
- Better efficiency (no 4-8% UPS conversion losses)
- Superior backup duration (3.3 hours vs. 5-15 minutes at each phase)
- Dual-purpose asset (solar storage + UPS function)

#### Scenario 3: Hybrid BESS + Small UPS (Conservative Fallback)

**Architecture:** BESS provides primary backup, small UPS acts as "safety net" for risk-averse customers or lenders.

| Component         | Cost       | Notes                                  |
| ----------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------- |
| BESS (48MWh, 16MW)  | **$24.5-26.7M** | Primary backup (includes fire safety + controls) |
| Small UPS (400kW) | $0.2M      | "Safety net" for risk-averse stakeholders |
| Generators        | $7M        | Extended backup                        |
| **TOTAL**         | **$31.7-33.9M** | **SAVINGS: $6-8M vs traditional**                 |

**Note:** The $0.2M small UPS adds minimal technical value if BESS has grid-forming inverters. This is primarily a marketing/perception decision to ease lender/customer concerns.

### 3.3 Financial Comparison Summary

| Metric | Traditional (Baseline) | Phased BESS-as-UPS (Recommended) | Notes |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------------------|-------|
| **Phase 0 CAPEX** (25-35% occupancy) | $39.8-41.8M (all upfront) | **$21.65-22.65M** ‚úÖ | **$17-20M deferred** |
| **Phase 1 CAPEX** (50-60% occupancy) | - | **+$10.7-11.45M** | Cumulative: $32-34M |
| **Phase 2 CAPEX** (100% occupancy) | - | **+$10.7-11.45M** | Cumulative: $43-46M |
| **Total CAPEX** (Full Buildout) | $39.8-41.8M | **$43.05-45.55M** ‚ö†Ô∏è | **+$1-4M more at full build** |
| **Deferred CAPEX (NPV Benefit)** | - | **~$17M NPV** (@ 10% discount) ‚úÖ | Defers $20M by 12-24 months |
| **UPS Layer** | 12.4MW traditional | None (BESS only) | Eliminates $8-10M UPS cost |
| **Backup Duration** | 5-15 min + generators | **3.3 hrs @ each phase** ‚úÖ | 13-20√ó longer than UPS |
| **Annual O&M** | $1,000k | $555k ‚úÖ | -$445k/year savings |
| **10-Year TCO** | $49.8-51.8M | **$48.5-51.0M** ‚úÖ | Breakeven to slight savings |
| **Cash Flow Advantage** | None | **Massive** ‚úÖ | Start with $22M vs. $40M |

**Key Insights:**

**Why Phased BESS Costs More at Full Buildout (+$1-4M):**
1. **Modular Overhead:** 3 deployment phases vs. 1 (multiple commissioning cycles)
2. **Fire Safety Scales Non-Linearly:** Base infrastructure costs spread across smaller Phase 0
3. **Integration Complexity:** Each phase requires 2-week commissioning (3 phases = 6 weeks total)

**Why Phased BESS is Still Better:**
1. **Enables Project Launch:** $22M initial vs. $40M makes project financeable
2. **NPV Advantage:** Deferring $20M CAPEX by 18 months = ~$17M NPV benefit (@ 10% discount rate)
3. **Revenue Alignment:** Only deploy batteries when tenants lease space and pay rent
4. **Reduced Financing Costs:** Lower debt service on $22M initial vs. $40M
5. **Operational Savings:** $445k/year O&M savings offsets higher CAPEX within 2-3 years

**Break-Even Analysis:**
- Higher CAPEX at full build: +$1-4M
- Annual O&M savings: $445k/year
- Payback on incremental CAPEX: 2-9 years
- NPV benefit from deferred deployment: ~$17M
- **Net NPV Advantage: ~$13-16M** (accounts for higher CAPEX + O&M savings + deferred investment)

### 3.4 Phased Deployment Strategy (REVISED - Batteries Scale Too)

Given that the facility will lease up gradually over 18-36 months, a phased BESS deployment (batteries AND inverters) optimizes cash flow:

**Phase 0 - Initial Deployment (Day 1, 25-35% Occupancy):**
- Deploy **2√ó4MW inverters + 16MWh batteries** (4 containers)
- **4MW available with N+1** (lose one 4MW inverter, still serve load)
- Supports 2-3 MW IT load (~25-35% facility occupancy)
- Backup duration: **3.3 hours @ 4MW**
- Cost: **$21.65-22.65M**
- **Triggers Phase 1:** When facility reaches ~40% leased (5 MW committed IT load)

**Phase 1 - Mid-Scale Expansion (40-50% Occupancy Trigger):**
- Add **1√ó4MW inverter + 16MWh batteries** (4 more containers)
- Cumulative: **12MW total, 8MW available N+1**
- Supports 5-6 MW IT load (~50-60% facility occupancy)
- Backup duration: **3.3 hours @ 8MW**
- Incremental cost: **+$10.7-11.45M**
- Cumulative investment: **$32.35-34.1M**
- **Triggers Phase 2:** When facility reaches ~70% leased (7 MW committed IT load)

**Phase 2 - Full Buildout (70-80% Occupancy Trigger):**
- Add **1√ó4MW inverter + 16MWh batteries** (4 more containers)
- Cumulative: **16MW total, 12MW available N+1**
- Supports 7.4 MW IT load (100% facility occupancy)
- Backup duration: **3.3 hours @ 12MW**
- Incremental cost: **+$10.7-11.45M**
- Total deployed cost: **$43.05-45.55M**

**Key Requirements (Build for 3 Phases, Deploy in Stages):**
- **Size electrical infrastructure for 4 inverters from Day 1:**
  - Buswork: 16MW continuous rating
  - Breakers: 4 positions (2 occupied Phase 0, add 1 per phase)
  - Conduit: Pre-wired for all 4 inverters
- **Size BESS pad for 12 containers from Day 1:**
  - Total pad: 6,000 SF (accommodates 12 containers + 4 inverters)
  - Phase 0: Occupy 1,500 SF (4 containers + 2 inverters)
  - Remaining space: Temp barriers/fencing until needed
- **Procurement Strategy:**
  - Execute master contract in Phase 0 with options to purchase Phase 1/2 equipment
  - Lock pricing for all 3 phases (hedge against price increases)
  - Same vendor/model across all phases (plug-and-play compatibility)
  - 2-week commissioning window per phase (vs. 3-4 months for full system)
- **Fire Suppression Scales:**
  - Phase 0: 4 containers = $1.8M (includes base infrastructure)
  - Phase 1/2: 4 containers each = $1.2M per phase (incremental)
  - Total NFPA 855: $4.2M across all phases

**Financial Benefit:**
- **Deferred CAPEX: ~$20-23M** (12-24 months deployment delay for Phase 1/2)
- **NPV Benefit: ~$17M** (@ 10% discount rate on deferred investment)
- Improved cash flow alignment with revenue ramp (only deploy when tenants lease)
- Reduced financing costs on deferred equipment (lower initial debt service)
- Preserved full system capability when needed (infrastructure sized for 3 phases)

**Risk Mitigation:**
- **Price Escalation:** Lock Phase 1/2 pricing in Phase 0 contract (option to purchase)
- **Technology Risk:** Later phases benefit from battery cost declines (market trend: -40% in 2024)
- **Modular Complexity:** Use same vendor/model; pre-wire infrastructure; 2-week commissioning per phase
- **Demand Risk:** If lease-up slower than expected, avoid deploying unused batteries (vs. V2 approach)
- **Flexibility:** Can adjust Phase 1/2 sizing based on actual tenant power density

**Infrastructure Sizing Requirements:**

**Electrical Infrastructure (Size for 4, Build for 4):**
- Substation transformer: 15-20 MVA (supports full 16MW BESS + 10MW load)
- 13.8kV switchgear: 4 breaker positions for BESS inverters (all installed day 1)
- DC buswork: Sized for 16MW continuous rating
- AC distribution: 4 inverter connection points with isolation breakers

**Physical Infrastructure:**
- BESS enclosure: 4,500 SF (accommodates 4 inverters + 12 battery containers)
- Inverter foundation pads: Install 4 pads in Phase 1 (occupy pad 4 with temp barrier)
- Cable trays/conduit: Route for all 4 inverters in Phase 1
- Fire suppression: Size for full 4-inverter layout

**Procurement Strategy:**
- Execute equipment contract with option to purchase 4th inverter
- Lock pricing and delivery terms for Phase 2 inverter
- Maintain spare parts compatibility across both phases
- Coordinate with EPC for installation readiness

**Phase 2 Trigger Point:**
- Target: When facility reaches **~75% leased** (~7.5MW committed IT load)
- Lead time: 6-9 months from order to commissioning
- Coordination: Plan installation during scheduled maintenance window

## 4. SOLAR + BESS INTEGRATION

### 4.1 Solar System Overview

**From Feasibility Memo V3 and BOD Part 1:**
- **Capacity:** 12 MW DC solar array
- **Ownership:** Saga Energy (project owner)
- **Configuration:** Behind-the-meter (BTM), single point of interconnection (POI)
- **Location:** On-site, adjacent to data center facility

### 4.2 Daytime Operation (Solar Available)

**Energy Flow Priority:**
1. **Solar ‚Üí Direct Load:** Solar PV feeds critical DC load directly (up to 10 MW)
2. **Excess Solar ‚Üí BESS Charging:** When solar > load, excess charges BESS (max 12 MW charge rate, 0.25C)
3. **Full BESS ‚Üí Grid Export or Curtailment:** When BESS reaches 100% SOC:
   - Option A: Export to grid (if net metering agreement exists)
   - Option B: Curtail solar (if behind-the-meter only)
   - **Status:** Grid export strategy TBD pending Camelot Task 1 (interconnection analysis)

**BESS State of Charge Management:**
- Target SOC during daylight: **90-100%** (ensures full backup capacity always available)
- Minimum SOC before generator start: **20%** (80% depth of discharge)
- Recharge from generators: During low-load periods if extended outage continues

### 4.3 Nighttime Operation (Solar Unavailable)

**Energy Flow:**
1. **BESS ‚Üí Load:** BESS discharges to serve facility load
2. **Grid-Forming Mode:** BESS inverters maintain power quality continuously (no transfer)
3. **Generators on Standby:** Remain ready but not running
4. **BESS Provides 3.3-4.9 Hours:** Sufficient backup until sunrise or generator start

### 4.4 BESS Charge/Discharge Cycling

**Annual Cycling Profile:**
- **Daily cycles:** ~250-300 days/year (charge from solar during day, discharge at night)
- **Partial cycles:** Typical depth ~30-50% (not full 80% DoD every day)
- **Cycle life:** 6,000 cycles @ 80% DoD = **20-24 year lifespan**
- **Replacement strategy:** Single replacement at Year 15 (as budgeted in V2)

**Why This Doesn't Degrade Batteries Prematurely:**
- LFP chemistry tolerates daily cycling better than NMC
- Shallow cycles (30-50% DoD) extend lifespan significantly
- Active thermal management prevents degradation from temperature
- 6,000 cycle warranty @ 80% DoD = 20,000+ cycles @ 40% DoD

### 4.5 Grid Interconnection Dependencies

**CRITICAL ASSUMPTION:** This analysis assumes a **grid-tied microgrid** configuration, NOT a fully grid-independent system.

**Pending Decisions (Dependent on Camelot Task 1 Results):**

| Decision | Option A | Option B | Status |
|----------|----------|----------|--------|
| **POI Configuration** | Single POI, 138 kV service | Dual POI (redundancy) | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Pending Camelot** |
| **Grid Backup** | Utility provides backup to BESS | Stand-alone (no grid backup) | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Pending Camelot** |
| **Solar Export** | Export to grid (net metering) | Behind-the-meter only (no export) | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Pending Camelot** |
| **Interconnection Study** | Single interconnection request | Separate solar + DC applications | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Pending Camelot** |

**Impact on BESS Strategy:**
- **Grid-Tied (Assumed):** Utility provides ultimate backup; BESS + generators cover outages <24 hours
- **Grid-Independent (Not Assumed):** Would require larger BESS or more generators; cost would increase $5-10M

**Critical Path Action:**
- **By Nov 7:** Confirm grid interconnection strategy from Camelot Task 1
- **If Grid-Independent Required:** Re-evaluate BESS sizing (may need 64-96 MWh instead of 48 MWh)

### 4.6 Microgrid Control Modes

**Mode 1: Normal Operation (Grid + Solar Available)**
1. Solar generates ‚Üí Feeds DC load directly + charges BESS
2. BESS maintains 90-100% State of Charge
3. BESS inverters operate in grid-forming mode, conditioning all power to IT load
4. Utility grid provides supplemental power if solar + BESS < load
5. Generators remain on standby

**Mode 2: Grid Outage, Solar Available**
1. Microgrid controller detects grid loss
2. BESS seamlessly islands (0ms transition, already grid-forming)
3. Solar continues generating ‚Üí BESS balances load
4. If solar > load: BESS charges (no curtailment needed)
5. Generators remain on standby

**Mode 3: Grid Outage, Solar Insufficient / Nighttime**
1. BESS discharges to serve load
2. Grid-forming inverters maintain power quality continuously
3. BESS SOC decreases from 90-100% toward 20% threshold
4. At 30% SOC: Microgrid controller initiates generator start sequence
5. Generators start, stabilize, take over load (15-20 minute process)
6. BESS recharges from generators during low-load periods

**Mode 4: Extended Outage (>4 hours)**
1. Generators run continuously, powering load
2. BESS maintains 50-80% SOC (reserve for transients)
3. Solar (if available) offsets generator load during daytime
4. Generators recharge BESS overnight
5. When utility returns: Smooth transition back to Mode 1

**Critical Point:** At no point is traditional UPS needed. The BESS grid-forming inverters provide continuous power conditioning in all operating modes.

| **Fire Suppression** | Included in UPS room | Separate NFPA 855 system | **+$3.5M** ‚ö†Ô∏è |

**Net Space Impact:**
- **Indoor space savings:** -3,500 SF (UPS + batteries eliminated)
- **Outdoor space required:** +5,000 SF (BESS enclosure + transformer pad)
- **Benefit:** Repurpose 3,500 SF of climate-controlled indoor space for IT or office use

**Site Plan Considerations:**
- BESS enclosure located adjacent to solar field (minimize cable runs)
- Separation distance from data center: 50-100 feet (NFPA 855 requirement)
- Fire barriers and setbacks: Integrated into enclosure design
- Access for maintenance: 25-foot clearance on 2 sides for container removal

### 5.4 Cost Impact Summary

| Item | RD109 Baseline Cost | BESS-as-UPS Cost | Net Change |
|------|---------------------|------------------|------------|
| **UPS System** | +$8-10M | $0 | **-$8-10M** ‚úÖ |
| **BESS (Phase 1)** | $0 | +$21.7-23.2M | **+$21.7-23.2M** ‚ö†Ô∏è |

| **TOTAL (Phase 1)** | **$15.8-17.8M** | **$30.5-32.7M** | **+$12.9-16.7M** |

**But BESS Provides Dual Value:**
- **Solar Storage:** BESS enables 12MW solar integration (not included in baseline)
- **Extended Backup:** 3.3-4.9 hours vs. 5-15 minutes (UPS)
- **Energy Efficiency:** Eliminates 4-8% UPS conversion losses

**Net Assessment:**
- **BESS-as-UPS costs +$12.9-16.7M more** than traditional RD109 UPS-only
- **BUT: Baseline doesn't include solar integration** (would add ~$19M for traditional architecture)
- **Apples-to-Apples (Solar + Backup):** BESS saves **$6.5-8.5M** vs. Traditional UPS + BESS-for-solar

## 8. DECISION CRITERIA

### 8.1 Choose Pure BESS-as-UPS If:

**Technical Requirements (Must Confirm):**
‚úÖ BESS vendor confirms **grid-forming inverter capability** (Tesla, Fluence, W√§rtsil√§ all offer this)
‚úÖ You can implement **IEEE 2030.7/2030.8 compliant controls** (budget $1.85M allocated)
‚úÖ You complete **Factory Acceptance Test (FAT)** and **Site Acceptance Test (SAT)** (included in controls budget)
‚úÖ **NFPA 855 fire suppression systems** designed and budgeted ($3.5M allocated)
‚úÖ **N+1 inverter redundancy** implemented (4√ó4MW inverters, 16MW total)

**Financial Requirements (Validate):**
‚ö†Ô∏è **Insurance quotes confirm BESS-only architecture acceptable** (<$100k/year premium vs. traditional)
‚ö†Ô∏è **Project IRR remains ‚â•14%** with updated CAPEX ($33.3-36.2M vs. $39.8-41.8M baseline)
‚ö†Ô∏è **Lenders approve non-traditional architecture** (independent engineering review may be required)
‚ö†Ô∏è **Vendor quotes validate cost estimates** (issue RFIs by Oct 25, increase confidence to 80%+)

**Operational Requirements (Commit To):**
‚ö†Ô∏è **Saga Energy will hire BESS-qualified engineer** (~$100-130k/year for operations)
‚ö†Ô∏è **24/7 vendor remote monitoring contracted** ($50-100k/year service agreement)
‚ö†Ô∏è **Detailed commissioning plan with 18-24 month timeline** (critical path item)
‚ö†Ô∏è **Staff training program** (3-5 days onsite + annual refresher)

**Stakeholder Acceptance:**
‚úÖ You're comfortable marketing **"BESS-powered data center"** as competitive advantage
‚úÖ Investors/lenders accept **savings of $6.5-8.5M** as reasonable trade for non-traditional design
‚úÖ You want to **maximize financial returns** (16-20% CAPEX reduction + $445k/year O&M savings)

### 8.2 Consider Hybrid BESS + Small UPS If:

**Stakeholder Risk Aversion:**
‚ö†Ô∏è **Lenders/insurance absolutely require seeing "UPS" on equipment list** (even if redundant)
‚ö†Ô∏è **Customer base is extremely risk-averse** (finance, healthcare, government)
‚ö†Ô∏è **Investors need "traditional" architecture** for comfort (even if technically unnecessary)
‚ö†Ô∏è You prefer a **"safety net" during initial commissioning period** (first 6-12 months)

**Certification Concerns:**
‚ö†Ô∏è You want formal **Uptime Institute Tier III certification** (not just "equivalent")
‚ö†Ô∏è **Industry perception matters more than technical reality** (marketing to conservative customers)

**Cost/Benefit:**
- Hybrid adds **$0.2M for small UPS** (minimal CAPEX increase)
- Total cost: **$31.7-33.9M** (still $6-8M savings vs. traditional)
- **Provides minimal technical value** if BESS has grid-forming inverters
- This is primarily a **marketing/perception decision**, not a technical necessity

### 8.3 Avoid BESS-as-UPS Approach If:

**Technical Showstoppers:**
‚ùå **BESS vendor cannot confirm grid-forming inverter capability** (must be grid-forming, not grid-following)
‚ùå **Microgrid controls budget is <$1M** (inadequate for IEEE 2030.7/8 compliance)
‚ùå **Operations team cannot commit to BESS-specific training** (knowledge gap = operational risk)
‚ùå **Project timeline cannot accommodate 18-24 month commissioning** (BESS lead time + FAT/SAT)

**Financial Showstoppers:**
‚ùå **Insurance quotes show >$150k/year premium** for BESS-only vs. traditional architecture
‚ùå **Lenders reject non-traditional design** even with independent engineering review
‚ùå **BESS vendor quotes come in >$30M** (Phase 1 alone), destroying financial case
‚ùå **Project IRR drops below 12%** with updated costs

**Operational Showstoppers:**
‚ùå **No local BESS service network** within 4-hour response time of Pryor, OK
‚ùå **Vendor cannot provide 24/7 remote monitoring** (operational risk too high)
‚ùå **AHJ (Authority Having Jurisdiction) rejects NFPA 855 design** without extensive modifications

**Fallback Strategy:**
If any showstoppers occur, revert to **Traditional UPS + BESS-for-Solar architecture** (Scenario 1):
- Cost: $39.8-41.8M (vs. $33.3-36.2M for BESS-as-UPS)
- Loss of $6.5-8.5M savings, but proven, low-risk approach
- Still retains solar integration and renewable energy benefits
