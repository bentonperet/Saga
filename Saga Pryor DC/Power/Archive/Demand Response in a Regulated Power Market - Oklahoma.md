Demand Response in a Regulated Power Market - Oklahoma

  

# 1. Status of Electricity Market Deregulation in Oklahoma

The electricity market in Oklahoma is not deregulated for most customers.

- Regulated Market: Oklahoma operates under a traditional, regulated utility model. Major utility companies, primarily Oklahoma Gas & Electric (OG&E) and Public Service Company of Oklahoma (PSO), are vertically integrated. This means they own and operate the generation (power plants), transmission (high-voltage lines), and distribution (local wires) infrastructure, and they serve defined service territories.
    
- Rate Regulation: Utility rates are subject to regulatory oversight and approval by the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (OCC), which is intended to protect consumers.
    
- Legislation for Large Consumers (Data Centers): There has been recent legislative movement, particularly around the large-scale power demand of data centers. State law has been considered and, in some cases, passed to allow for flexibility, such as "Behind-the-Meter" (BTM) generation statutes (like HB 1374), which permit large industrial consumers to develop and manage their own power solutions to alleviate pressure on the grid and bypass some grid connection delays. This move caters to the unique needs of large loads without fully deregulating the retail market.
    

Conclusion: You will be served by the geographically assigned utility (OG&E, PSO, or a municipal/co-op), and your rates will be based on their regulated tariffs, though you may be able to negotiate a special contract or tariff due to your size.

  

# 2. Demand Response (Load Shedding) Programs in Oklahoma

Despite the regulated market, the major utilities in Oklahoma offer demand response (DR) or load reduction programs designed to manage peak electricity demand, which could be highly beneficial for a data center with on-site generation (BESS and turbines).

Leveraging your BESS and turbines for these programs offers a "value stack" opportunity to monetize your backup infrastructure.

## A. Public Service Company of Oklahoma (PSO)

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Program|Type|Benefit to Data Center|
|Peak Performers|Load Reduction / Demand Response|PSO rewards commercial and industrial customers with cash incentives for voluntarily reducing or shifting electricity use during a "Peak Event" (times of high demand, typically summer afternoons).|
|Incentives|Financial Payment|Participants earn substantial annual incentives, often structured as a payment per Average Kilowatt Savings (kW reduced). For a large load like yours, this could be a significant revenue stream.|
|Operational Fit|Excellent|The data center's on-site BESS/Turbine microgrid is perfectly suited for this. When PSO calls an event, the MGS can instantly isolate the facility from the grid and run on the BESS/Turbine, resulting in a 100% load reduction to the grid, maximizing the incentive payment.|

## B. Oklahoma Gas & Electric (OG&E)

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Program|Type|Benefit to Data Center|
|Load Reduction Program|Performance-Based DR|OG&E offers financial incentives to commercial and industrial customers that curtail their electrical load when notified. Customers subscribe to a specific demand reduction amount and receive a discount/incentive when they perform.|
|Day Ahead Pricing|Time-of-Use / Load Shifting|Businesses can lower energy costs by shifting use to the times of the day when rates are lower, as OG&E notifies hourly rates the day before. This is useful for charging the BESS when electricity is cheapest (e.g., late night/early morning).|
|Operational Fit|Very Good|Similar to PSO, using your microgrid to shed all load from the OG&E system during a "Load Reduction Program" event maximizes the financial incentive. The Day Ahead Pricing can be used by the MGS software to optimize BESS charging from the grid (if connected) or to schedule turbine run times for minimum fuel cost.|

## C. Oklahoma Municipal Power Authority (OMPA)

- The Demand & Energy Efficiency Program (DEEP), offered through OMPA member municipal utilities (like Edmond Electric), also offers rebates for measures that reduce summer peak electric demand, which a large, new facility could utilize.
    

# 3. Strategic Consideration: Interruptible vs. Reliable Service

Historically, data centers avoid interruptible rates because their core operations demand high reliability. However, with your robust BESS/Turbine microgrid, your data center can participate in demand response programs without sacrificing reliability.

- The BESS Advantage: Your BESS/Turbine system is designed to provide critical power redundancy. By offering your load to the utility for a demand response payment, you are effectively monetizing your redundancy. You receive an incentive for "shedding" your load, but your IT equipment remains online and fully protected by your MW-scale BESS and thermal generators.
    
- The BTM Advantage: The local utility may be more willing to grant a beneficial rate or contract if you leverage your BTM generation to mitigate the infrastructure strain you place on the grid, especially during peak times.
    

Recommendation: Your project should engage directly with the relevant utility's economic development or large load account management team to negotiate a custom rate or tariff that includes maximum participation in their load reduction program, leveraging your self-supply capability (solar, BESS, and turbine) to secure the best blend of price stability and financial incentives.
