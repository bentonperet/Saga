**Rationale:**
- Market data for 3750 kVA units: **$1.3-2.2M installed**
- **4 units = $5.2-8.8M range**
- Your $8M is at the **high end** but not unreasonable IF:
  - Dual-fuel configuration
  - Indoor installation OR premium tornado-rated enclosures
  - 72-hour fuel storage
  - Oklahoma-specific permitting/acoustic requirements

**Concerns:**
- If assuming **standard outdoor diesel** with **24-hour fuel storage**, market pricing suggests **$6.5-7.0M** is more realistic
- Your estimate may be **$1-1.5M high** (13-19% overestimate)

**Recommendation:**
⚠️ **GET VENDOR QUOTES** - Your $8M needs validation. Likely scenarios:
- **Conservative (diesel, outdoor, 24hr fuel):** $6.5-7.0M
- **Mid-case (nat gas or dual-fuel, outdoor):** $7.0-7.5M
- **Premium (dual-fuel, tornado-rated, 72hr fuel):** $7.5-8.5M
