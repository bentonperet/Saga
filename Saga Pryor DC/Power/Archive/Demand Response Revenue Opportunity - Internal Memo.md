# DEMAND RESPONSE REVENUE OPPORTUNITY
## Internal Decision Memo - Saga Pryor DC

**Date:** October 20, 2025
**Version:** 3.0 - Executive Summary
**Prepared by:** PGCIS Program Management Team
**Purpose:** Internal decision-making on OG&E demand response program enrollment

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Bottom Line:** OG&E's demand response program could generate **$150K-$300K/year** starting Phase 1 (Month 12+) when grid-connected. We can participate **without sacrificing N+1 redundancy** by islanding during peak events on our solar + BESS + generator microgrid (~1.5 hours effort per event, 6-10 events/year).

## THE OPPORTUNITY

**OG&E Load Reduction Program:**
- Performance-based DR for commercial/industrial customers
- **Incentive:** $25-35/kW/year estimated (needs OG&E confirmation)
- **Events:** 6-10/year, 2-4 hours each, summer peak (June-Sept)
- **Voluntary:** Can opt out without penalty

**Mechanics:** Enroll capacity → 2+ hour notice → Island to microgrid → OG&E measures reduction → Payment → Reconnect

## ENROLLMENT STRATEGY BY PHASE

| Phase | Occupancy | Total Load | Generator N+1 | Enrollment | Annual Revenue |
|-------|-----------|------------|---------------|------------|----------------|
| **Phase 1** (Month 12) | 40% | 6-7 MW | 8 MW ✅ | 6,000-6,500 kW | $150K-$227K |
| **Phase 2** (Month 24) | 100% | 9.5 MW | 12 MW ✅ | 9,000-9,500 kW | $225K-$332K |

**Rate Assumption:** $25-35/kW/year (needs OG&E confirmation)
**N+1 Maintained:** All enrollment levels preserve full redundancy


## OPERATIONAL SCENARIO

**Typical DR Event (2-4 hours, summer afternoon):**

**Event Notification (2+ hours advance):**
OG&E alerts NOC → Verify BESS ≥90% SOC and generators ready

**During Event:**
Microgrid controller islands facility → Solar + BESS + generators power entire load → **Zero customer disruption, utility sees zero load = maximum payment**

**Post-Event:**
Reconnect to grid → Recharge BESS overnight → Document for utility reconciliation

## RISKS & CONSIDERATIONS

**OG&E Rate Uncertainty:** Incentive may be <$25/kW → Confirm during Q4 2025 utility engagement. Fallback: Even at $20/kW generates $120-190K/year.

**Islanding Restrictions:** Interconnection agreement may limit full disconnection (10% likelihood given HB 1374 BTM legislation) → Negotiate minimum load allowance if needed (~$15K/year impact).

**Customer Perception:** Communicate clearly that DR = zero customer impact (disconnecting from grid, not powering down). Maintains 99.99%+ SLA. Position as grid-independent uptime advantage.

## QUESTIONS FOR OG&E (Q4 2025)

1. Current incentive rate ($/kW) for Load Reduction Program?
2. How many events dispatched summer 2024?
3. Can we fully island during events, or minimum load required?
4. Does DR participation qualify for reduced demand charges/custom rates?
5. Enrollment timeline to be ready by Month 12?
6. Multi-year rate lock option available?
