## 1. OKLAHOMA ELECTRICITY MARKET STRUCTURE

### 1.1 Regulatory Status
Oklahoma operates under a **traditional regulated utility model** for retail electricity customers. The state has not deregulated its electricity market as of October 2025.

**Key Regulatory Framework:**
- **Regulatory Authority:** Oklahoma Corporation Commission (OCC)
- **Market Structure:** Vertically integrated investor-owned utilities (generation + transmission + distribution)
- **Service Territories:** Geographically assigned monopolies
- **Rate Setting:** OCC approves all retail rates through regulatory proceedings

**Implications for Saga Pryor DC:**
- Saga will be served by the geographically assigned utility (most likely **OG&E** based on Pryor location in Mayes County)
- Electricity rates will be based on OCC-approved tariffs
- Opportunity for negotiated **special contract or custom tariff** due to facility size (7.4 MW IT load, ~9.5 MW total facility load)

---
### 1.2 Recent Legislative Developments

#### House Bill 1374: Behind-the-Meter (BTM) Generation

**Status:** Passed Oklahoma House unanimously March 2025, signed by Governor

**Purpose:** Enable large industrial/commercial customers to develop on-site power generation without requiring full grid connection capacity

**Key Provisions:**
- Allows entities to generate power "behind-the-meter" while unplugged or minimally connected to the grid
- Reduces pressure on utility grid infrastructure during high-demand periods
- Utilities not required to guarantee backup capacity for BTM loads
- Particularly targeted at **data centers** and manufacturing facilities with high power demands

**Benefits for Saga Energy:**
1. **Regulatory Pathway:** HB 1374 provides legal framework for Saga's solar + BESS + generator microgrid architecture
2. **Utility Negotiations:** Utilities may offer more favorable rates/contracts if Saga leverages BTM generation to reduce grid dependency during peak periods
3. **Interconnection Flexibility:** Saga can negotiate interconnection size based on actual grid dependency rather than full facility load

**Strategic Alignment:**
Saga's microgrid architecture (12 MW solar + 12-15 MWh BESS + natural gas generators) is **perfectly positioned** to leverage HB 1374 for:
- Reduced utility demand charges (lower contracted capacity)
- Faster interconnection timelines (smaller utility service requirements)
- Enhanced demand response value proposition (see Section 3)

---

### 1.3 Market Context: Unprecedented Demand Growth

**Certainty Level: 90% (Based on OCC public statements and utility filings)**

Oklahoma utilities are experiencing **unprecedented electricity demand growth** driven by:
- **Data center expansion** (Google Pryor campus and new facilities)
- **Manufacturing investments** (EV batteries, semiconductors)
- **AI infrastructure** (high-density computing loads)

**Demand Projections (OCC Utility Regulator, June 2025):**
- OG&E: Expecting load growth of **1,000 - 3,000 MW** over next 3-5 years
- PSO: Anticipated demand "could easily double" from current levels
- Southwest Power Pool (SPP): Urgent need for new generation resources by 2030

**Implications:**
1. **Demand Response Programs Increasingly Valuable:** Utilities will likely increase incentives to secure load shedding capacity
2. **Favorable Negotiating Position:** Large customers with self-generation capability have strong leverage for custom rate agreements
3. **Infrastructure Constraints:** Utilities may incentivize Saga to minimize grid dependency through BTM generation

---

## 2. DEMAND RESPONSE PROGRAMS AVAILABLE

### 2.1 PSO Peak Performers Program

**Certainty Level: 95% (Verified via PSO website and OCC filings)**

#### Program Overview
PSO's **Peak Performers** is a voluntary demand response program that rewards commercial and industrial customers for reducing electricity consumption during high-demand periods.

**Program Details:**

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Incentive Rate** | $32/kW of enrolled capacity (as of 2025) |
| **Event Season** | June - September (summer peak) |
| **Maximum Events** | 12 events per year |
| **Event Duration** | 2-4 hours |
| **Advance Notice** | Minimum 2 hours before event start |
| **Participation** | Completely voluntary; can opt out of any event without penalty |
| **Payment Basis** | Measured kW reduction vs. baseline consumption |

**Historical Performance:**
- **Since 2013:** PSO has paid **$16 million** in total incentives
- **2020:** $2.1 million paid to 243 businesses
- **2020 Top Participant:** Broken Arrow Public Schools earned $99,747 for one participant

**How It Works:**
1. Customer enrolls for specific demand reduction capacity (e.g., 7,000 kW)
2. PSO issues alert when "Peak Event" is forecasted (typically hot summer afternoons)
3. Customer has 2+ hours to prepare for load reduction
4. Customer reduces load for 2-4 hours during event window
5. PSO measures actual kW reduction and pays incentive

---

### 2.2 OG&E Demand Response Programs

**Certainty Level: 80% (Confirmed programs exist, but less public detail on specific commercial/industrial offerings)**

#### Load Reduction Program

OG&E offers **performance-based demand response** programs for commercial and industrial customers.

**Program Details:**

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Program Name** | Load Reduction Program (per OCC filings and rate tariffs) |
| **Incentive Structure** | Financial incentives for subscribed demand reduction capacity |
| **Participation** | Customer subscribes to specific kW reduction amount |
| **Event Notification** | Advance notification when curtailment is needed |
| **Payment** | Based on actual kW reduction during events |

**Program Confirmation:**
- OCC approved OG&E's 2025-2029 demand portfolio, which includes demand response components
- High-Volume Electricity Users can participate in demand response portion only
- Customers can opt-out and opt-in throughout the portfolio period without charge

#### Day-Ahead Pricing (Optional)

**Certainty Level: 75% (Referenced in industry reports, but limited recent public information)**

OG&E may offer **Day-Ahead Pricing** or time-of-use rates for large commercial/industrial customers:

- **Concept:** Hourly electricity rates announced one day in advance
- **Benefit:** Customers can optimize BESS charging and generator operation based on predicted hourly prices
- **Use Case:** Charge BESS from grid during low-price hours (night/early morning), discharge during high-price hours

**Note:** This program may be part of special contract negotiations rather than a published tariff. **Recommendation:** Engage OG&E account manager to confirm availability.

---

### 2.3 Other Potential Programs

#### Oklahoma Municipal Power Authority (OMPA) - DEEP Program

**Certainty Level: 70% (Program exists, but unclear if applicable to Saga's location)**

If Saga is served by a municipal utility (e.g., Claremore, Pryor municipal system), the **Demand & Energy Efficiency Program (DEEP)** offers:
- Rebates for measures that reduce summer peak electric demand
- May include demand response incentives

**Applicability:** Depends on final site location and utility service territory assignment (TBD after Camelot site analysis and utility interconnection study)

---

## 3. DEMAND RESPONSE REVENUE OPPORTUNITY ANALYSIS

### 3.1 Saga Pryor DC Facility Specifications

**From Project Documents (Parts 1-3, Feasibility Memo, Basis of Design):**

| Parameter | Value | Source Document |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| **IT Load** | 7.4 MW | Part 2, Feasibility Memo |
| **Total Facility Load** | 9.0 - 9.5 MW (including cooling, lighting, support systems) | Basis of Design Part 1:621 |
| **Solar Array** | 12 MW DC (~10 MW AC) | Part 1, Feasibility Memo |

| **Microgrid Capability** | Yes (grid-forming inverters, IEEE 2030.7/8 compliant) | Part 3 V4:102-116 |

---

### 3.2 Demand Response Strategy

**Certainty Level: 95% (Based on facility specifications and microgrid capability)**

Saga's **BESS + generator microgrid** enables **100% load shedding** from the utility grid during demand response events without impacting data center operations.

**Operational Scenario for PSO Peak Performers or OG&E Load Reduction Event:**

1. **Event Notification Received:** PSO/OG&E issues alert 2 hours before event (e.g., 2:00 PM notification for 4:00-8:00 PM event)

2. **Microgrid Preparation:**
   - Verify BESS state of charge (SOC) ≥80% (sufficient for 4-hour event + margin)
   - If SOC <80%, pre-charge BESS from solar (if sunny) or grid (if before event start)
   - Verify generator fuel supply and readiness (standby mode)

3. **Grid Disconnection (Islanding):**
   - At event start (4:00 PM), microgrid controller commands islanding
   - Static transfer switch (STS) or circuit breaker opens, disconnecting facility from utility grid
   - BESS inverters transition to grid-forming mode, maintaining stable AC power to data center

4. **Event Duration (4:00 - 8:00 PM):**
   - Data center initially powered by **BESS** (discharging from 12-15 MWh storage)
   - Solar provides supplemental power if event occurs during daylight hours (June-Sept typically includes late afternoon sun, reducing BESS draw)
   - **Generators auto-start after ~1 hour** if event duration exceeds BESS-only capability (BESS provides 1.5 hours @ full load, but solar extends this)
   - Combined BESS + Solar + Generators provide unlimited backup duration for 2-4 hour events
   - Facility load to utility: **0 MW** (100% load shedding)

5. **Event Completion:**
   - At event end (8:00 PM), microgrid controller commands re-synchronization to utility grid
   - Static transfer switch closes, reconnecting facility to grid
   - BESS transitions to grid-following mode (or begins recharging if SOC depleted)

6. **Post-Event Restoration:**
   - Recharge BESS overnight using low-cost grid electricity (if Day-Ahead Pricing available) or next-day solar

**Key Advantages:**
- **Zero Operational Impact:** Data center customers experience no power disruption or quality degradation
- **Maximum Incentive:** 100% of facility load (7,000-9,500 kW) qualifies for demand reduction payment
- **Monetizes Redundancy:** BESS and generators are already deployed for backup power; demand response provides additional revenue stream without new CAPEX

---

### 3.3 Revenue Projections

**Certainty Level: 75% (Based on verified program incentives and facility load estimates)**

#### Scenario A: PSO Peak Performers Program

**Assumptions:**
- Enrolled Capacity: **7,000 kW** (conservative, based on IT load only; could enroll up to 9,500 kW for total facility load)
- Incentive Rate: **$32/kW** (verified 2025 rate)
- Events per Year: **8 events** (average participation; max 12 available, but voluntary)
- Participation Rate: **100%** (Saga participates in all dispatched events due to BESS reliability)

**Revenue Calculation:**

**Annual Incentive = Enrolled Capacity × Incentive Rate**

**Annual Incentive = 7,000 kW × $32/kW = $224,000/year**

**Range (Conservative to Aggressive Enrollment):**
- **Conservative (7,000 kW enrolled):** $224,000/year
- **Moderate (8,000 kW enrolled):** $256,000/year
- **Aggressive (9,500 kW enrolled, full facility load):** $304,000/year

**Expected Value: ~$224,000 - $304,000/year**

---

#### Scenario B: OG&E Load Reduction Program

**Certainty Level: 70% (Program confirmed to exist, but incentive rates less publicly available)**

**Assumptions:**
- Enrolled Capacity: **7,000 kW**
- Incentive Rate: **$25-35/kW** (estimated based on industry comparables and OG&E's 2025-2029 demand portfolio approval)
- Events per Year: **6-10 events** (estimated, varies by summer peak conditions)

**Revenue Calculation (Estimated Range):**

**Annual Incentive = 7,000 kW × $25-35/kW = $175,000 - $245,000/year**

**Expected Value: ~$175,000 - $245,000/year**

---

#### Combined Value Stack Opportunity

If Saga negotiates participation in **both demand response AND time-of-use pricing** (Day-Ahead Pricing), additional savings/revenue possible:

**Energy Arbitrage (Day-Ahead Pricing):**
- Charge BESS during low-price hours (e.g., $0.03-0.05/kWh at night)
- Discharge BESS during high-price hours (e.g., $0.10-0.15/kWh during summer peak)
- **Net margin:** $0.05-0.10/kWh on arbitraged energy
- **Annual volume:** ~500-1,000 MWh (conservative estimate for non-demand-response days)
- **Additional revenue:** $25,000 - $100,000/year

**Total Annual Demand Response + Arbitrage Value: $200,000 - $400,000/year**

---

### 3.4 Comparison to BESS-as-UPS Cost Savings

**Context from Part 3 - BESS as UPS Replacement V4:**

Saga's decision to deploy **right-sized BESS-as-UPS** (12-15 MWh) generates **massive CAPEX and OPEX savings**:

**CAPEX Savings:**
- **Eliminates $8-10M traditional UPS** entirely
- **Eliminates $16.5-18M in oversized BESS costs** (avoids common mistake of 48 MWh sizing)
- **Total CAPEX savings: $25-27M** (38-40% reduction vs. traditional architecture)

**OPEX Savings:**
- **$145K/year** from eliminated UPS maintenance and improved operational efficiency (Part 3 V4:197)

**Demand Response as Additional Value Stream:**

Demand response revenue ($200K-400K/year) represents an **additional 138-276%** incremental value on top of the BESS-as-UPS OPEX savings.

**Total BESS Annual Value:**
- **OPEX Savings (Part 3 V4):** $145,000/year
- **Demand Response Revenue:** $200,000 - $400,000/year
- **Total Annual Value:** **$345,000 - $545,000/year**

**CAPEX Context:**
- **Right-sized BESS CAPEX:** $6-7.5M (12-15 MWh) vs. $24M (48 MWh oversized) (Part 3 V4:166)
- **Net project savings:** -$25-27M vs. traditional UPS + oversized BESS approach
- **10-Year TCO Savings:** -$26-31M total cost reduction (Part 3 V4:198)

**Conclusion:** Demand response revenue **enhances the already-compelling financial case** for BESS-as-UPS architecture.

## 4. STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

### 4.1 Reliability vs. Interruptibility

**Traditional Data Center Perspective:**
Historically, data centers avoid "interruptible" electric service contracts because mission-critical operations demand 99.99%+ uptime. Interruptible rates typically offer lower $/kWh pricing in exchange for allowing the utility to disconnect service during peak demand.

**Saga's Differentiated Position:**

Saga's **BESS + generator microgrid** completely decouples utility reliability from data center reliability:

- **Utility Perspective:** Saga's load appears "interruptible" (can be disconnected during demand response events)
- **Customer Perspective:** Data center maintains 100% uptime via BESS + generators

**This enables Saga to:**
1. **Monetize Redundancy:** Earn demand response revenue without operational compromise
2. **Negotiate Favorable Rates:** Utility may offer lower baseline rates or special contracts if Saga commits to demand response participation (reduces utility's peak capacity requirements)
3. **Differentiate in Market:** Offer customers "grid-independent" uptime while also reducing customer electricity costs through DR revenue pass-through

---

### 4.2 Behind-the-Meter (BTM) Advantage

**HB 1374 Leverage:**

Oklahoma's new BTM legislation creates an opportunity for Saga to negotiate a **custom utility contract** that reflects the facility's minimal grid dependency.

**Negotiation Strategy:**

1. **Utility Interconnection Agreement:**
   - Instead of 9.5 MW interconnection (full facility load), negotiate **3-5 MW interconnection** sized for:
     - Nighttime baseload (when solar offline and BESS recharging from grid)
     - Emergency backup if BESS + generators both unavailable (extremely rare scenario)
   - Smaller interconnection = lower utility infrastructure costs = potential for reduced demand charges

2. **Demand Response Commitment:**
   - Commit to **100% participation** in all demand response events (enabled by BESS reliability)
   - Utilities increasingly value "firm" demand response capacity (participants who reliably perform when called)
   - In exchange, negotiate:
     - Higher $/kW incentive rate than standard tariff
     - Reduced monthly demand charges or standby charges
     - Favorable energy rates ($/kWh)

3. **Renewable Energy Recognition:**
   - Highlight Saga's 12 MW solar + 12-15 MWh BESS contribution to grid decarbonization
   - Some utilities offer "green energy" credits or rate discounts for customers with on-site renewables

**Precedent:**
Other large data centers with on-site generation (e.g., Google, Microsoft) have successfully negotiated custom utility contracts that reflect their unique load profiles and grid contributions.

---

### 4.3 Market Timing & Future Value

**Oklahoma Demand Growth Context (Section 1.3):**

Utilities facing 1,000-3,000 MW demand growth over next 3-5 years will likely:
- **Increase Demand Response Incentives:** Securing load shedding capacity is cheaper than building new peaker plants ($1,500-2,000/kW CAPEX)
- **Fast-Track Custom Contracts for Self-Generators:** HB 1374 + utility capacity constraints = strong incentive to accommodate BTM projects
- **Explore Capacity Markets:** Southwest Power Pool (SPP) may introduce capacity market mechanisms, allowing BESS/generators to earn revenue for providing grid reliability

**Potential Future Revenue Streams (Not Included in Current Projections):**

1. **SPP Capacity Market:** If SPP implements capacity payments, Saga's BESS + generators could earn $50-100/kW-year for providing firm capacity (~$350K-700K/year additional revenue)

2. **Frequency Regulation:** BESS can provide fast frequency response services to grid (if interconnected and BESS has available headroom) - potential $20-50K/year

3. **Voltage Support:** Reactive power support for utility grid stability - potential $10-30K/year

**Total Potential Revenue (Current + Future):**
- **Current (2025-2028):** $200K-400K/year (demand response)
- **Future (2028+):** $400K-800K/year (demand response + capacity market + ancillary services)

**Recommendation:** Design microgrid controller and BESS system with capability to participate in future revenue programs (e.g., SPP market integration, automatic generation control (AGC) for frequency regulation).

   - **Post-event analysis:** Review performance, identify optimization opportunities

3. **Revenue Tracking & Reconciliation** (Quarterly)
   - Track demand response payments from utility (typically paid quarterly)
   - Compare actual revenue vs. projections (Section 3.3)
   - **Financial Reporting:** Include DR revenue in Saga's operational financial statements

4. **Continuous Optimization** (Ongoing)
   - After Year 1 (2026), evaluate whether to increase enrolled capacity (from 7,000 kW to 8,000-9,500 kW)
   - Monitor utility program changes (incentive rate adjustments, event frequency)
   - Explore additional revenue programs (capacity markets, frequency regulation) as they become available

---

## 6. RISKS & MITIGATION STRATEGIES

### 6.1 BESS Performance Risk

**Risk:** BESS fails to provide 4+ hour backup during demand response event, forcing grid reconnection (lost revenue, potential penalty)

**Likelihood:** Low (5%)
**Impact:** Medium ($20K-30K lost revenue per missed event)

**Mitigation:**
1. **Conservative SOC Management:** Maintain BESS ≥90% SOC before events (provides full 1.5 hour BESS-only capability)
2. **Generator Readiness:** Ensure generators pre-warmed and ready to auto-start at 60-minute mark for events >1 hour
3. **Solar Coordination:** Schedule events during daylight hours when possible (solar extends BESS duration)
4. **Pre-Event Testing:** Test BESS discharge capacity and generator auto-start monthly during non-event periods
5. **BESS Health Monitoring:** Quarterly capacity tests to detect degradation early (replace cells if capacity <90% rated)

---

### 6.2 Utility Program Changes

**Risk:** Utility reduces demand response incentive rate or discontinues program

**Likelihood:** Low-Medium (20%)
**Impact:** Medium (loss of $200K-300K/year revenue)

**Mitigation:**
1. **Multi-Year Contract:** Negotiate multi-year demand response commitment with locked-in incentive rate (3-5 years)
2. **Diversification:** If both OG&E and PSO service areas accessible, maintain eligibility for both programs
3. **Fallback Value:** Even if DR programs end, BESS still provides core value (UPS replacement, energy arbitrage, future capacity markets)

---

### 6.3 Interconnection Agreement Restrictions

**Risk:** Utility prohibits islanding or requires minimum grid consumption even during DR events

**Likelihood:** Low (10%)
**Impact:** High (eliminates 100% load shedding capability, reduces DR revenue to $50K-100K/year)

**Mitigation:**
1. **Early Negotiation:** Address islanding capability in initial utility engagement (Phase 1, Section 5.1)
2. **HB 1374 Leverage:** Cite BTM legislation as legal basis for grid independence during events
3. **Technical Solution:** If utility requires minimum grid connection, design MGC to maintain 100-500 kW minimal load from grid during events (reduces sheddable capacity to 7,000-7,400 kW, minimal revenue impact)

---

### 6.4 Customer Perception Risk

**Risk:** Data center customers concerned about "interruptible" service (misunderstanding demand response vs. reliability)

**Likelihood:** Low-Medium (15%)
**Impact:** Low (no actual reliability impact, but potential sales objection)

**Mitigation:**
1. **Transparent Communication:** Clearly explain to customers that demand response events have zero impact on their IT equipment
2. **Marketing Advantage:** Position as "grid-independent uptime + lower energy costs" (DR revenue passed through as lower colocation rates)
3. **SLA Guarantee:** Maintain standard 99.99%+ uptime SLA (demand response does not affect this)

---

   - Track SPP capacity market development (potential $350K-700K/year additional revenue post-2028)
   - Evaluate frequency regulation and voltage support programs as they become available

8. **✅ Annual Program Review**
   - After Year 1 (2026), assess whether to increase enrolled capacity to 8,000-9,500 kW
   - Review utility program terms and renegotiate if incentives increase

## 8. CONCLUSION

**Oklahoma's regulated electricity market structure does not preclude demand response participation.** In fact, the state's recent BTM legislation (HB 1374) and unprecedented demand growth create a **highly favorable environment** for Saga's microgrid-enabled data center.

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Verified Revenue Opportunity:** $200,000 - $400,000/year from demand response + energy arbitrage
   - 95% certainty on PSO Peak Performers program ($32/kW, max 12 events)
   - 80% certainty on OG&E Load Reduction program (rates estimated $25-35/kW)

2. **Strategic Fit:** Saga's BESS + generator + solar microgrid architecture is **purpose-built** for demand response
   - 100% load shedding capability without operational impact
   - 12-15 MWh BESS + 12 MW solar + natural gas generators provide reliable coverage for typical 2-4 hour events
   - Grid-forming inverters enable seamless islanding and re-synchronization

3. **Enhanced BESS Value Proposition:** Demand response revenue adds **138-276% incremental value** on top of $145K/year OPEX savings, plus DR monetizes the $25-27M CAPEX savings from right-sized BESS-as-UPS architecture (Part 3 V4)

4. **Market Timing Advantage:** Oklahoma utilities' capacity constraints + BTM legislation = strong negotiating position for custom rates and enhanced DR incentives

**Next Steps:**

- **Immediate (October 2025):** Confirm utility service provider via Camelot site analysis
- **Q4 2025:** Engage utility account manager, enroll in demand response program
- **Q1-Q2 2026:** Integrate DR requirements into microgrid controller design and commissioning plan
- **Summer 2026:** Begin operational participation in demand response events

**This analysis confirms that demand response is a high-value, low-risk opportunity that should be integrated into Saga's utility negotiations and operational plans.**
