## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Oklahoma offers some of the **lowest electricity costs in the United States**, particularly for industrial and commercial customers. The state's combination of abundant wind resources, natural gas generation, and regulated utility structure creates highly competitive pricing.

**Lowest Benchmarks:**
- **Renewable (Wind PPA):** **$0.02-0.04/kWh**
- **Non-Renewable (Industrial Grid):** **$0.05-0.08/kWh**

---

## 1. RENEWABLE ENERGY BENCHMARKS

### 1.1 Wind Energy Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs)

**Benchmark Range:** **$0.02-0.04/kWh**

**Context:**
- Oklahoma ranks 2nd in U.S. wind generation capacity
- Long-term PPAs (10-20 years) with wind farms have achieved record-low pricing
- Projects in western Oklahoma (including Mayes County region) benefit from Class 4-5 wind resources

**Typical PPA Structure:**
- Fixed price over 15-20 year term
- No fuel price risk
- Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) typically included
- Behind-the-meter or virtual PPA options available

**Sources:**
- Project documents reference Oklahoma wind PPAs at $0.02-0.04/kWh
- Industry reports confirm Oklahoma as lowest-cost wind market in U.S.

---

### 1.2 Solar Energy

**Benchmark Range:** **$0.03-0.06/kWh** (estimated for utility-scale solar PPAs)

**Context:**
- Less developed than wind in Oklahoma market
- Behind-the-meter solar increasingly economic for data centers
- Solar arbitrage value modeled at **$0.08/kWh** net spread in project documents

**On-Site Solar Economics (from project analysis):**
- Capital cost: ~$1.00-1.25/W installed (12 MW system)
- Levelized cost of energy (LCOE): $0.03-0.05/kWh
- Peak generation aligns with data center daytime loads

---

## 2. NON-RENEWABLE ENERGY BENCHMARKS

### 2.1 Industrial/Commercial Grid Rates

**Benchmark Range:** **$0.05-0.08/kWh** (all-in average)

**Context:**
- Oklahoma industrial rates consistently rank in **bottom quartile nationally**
- Rates regulated by Oklahoma Corporation Commission (OCC)
- Service provided by investor-owned utilities (OG&E, PSO) or municipal utilities

**Rate Components (Typical Large Commercial/Industrial):**
- **Energy charge:** $0.03-0.05/kWh (base)
- **Demand charge:** $10-20/kW/month (if applicable)
- **Rider charges:** $0.005-0.015/kWh (fuel adjustment, renewable energy, etc.)

---

### 2.2 Time-of-Use Pricing

**Off-Peak (Nighttime):** **$0.03-0.05/kWh**
**On-Peak (Summer Afternoons):** **$0.10-0.15/kWh**

**Context:**
- Day-ahead pricing or time-of-use rates available for large customers
- Significant price differential creates arbitrage opportunity for battery storage
- SPP (Southwest Power Pool) wholesale market determines underlying costs

**From Project Documents:**
- Energy arbitrage modeling assumes $0.08/kWh net spread
- Peak periods: 4-8 PM during summer months (June-September)
- Off-peak charging: 10 PM - 6 AM at lowest rates

---

### 2.3 Demand Charges

**Benchmark Range:** **$10-20/kW/month** (estimated, needs utility confirmation)

**Context:**
- Not all Oklahoma commercial rates include demand charges
- Large industrial customers may negotiate custom rates
- Demand charge reduction potential: significant value for battery storage or microgrid

**From Project Modeling:**
- Assumed demand charge: **$15/kW/month**
- 4MW peak shaving value: $720k/year
- Status: **Requires confirmation with OG&E/PSO** for actual site

---

### 2.4 Residential Rates (Reference)

**Benchmark Range:** **$0.09-0.12/kWh**

**Context:**
- Not directly applicable to data center operations
- Included for market comparison
- Oklahoma residential rates also rank in bottom third nationally

---

## 3. WHOLESALE MARKET PRICING (SPP)

### 3.1 Southwest Power Pool (SPP) Real-Time Market

**Day-Ahead Market Range:** **-$20 to +$150/MWh** ($-0.02 to $0.15/kWh)

**Context:**
- Oklahoma is part of SPP regional transmission organization
- Wholesale prices highly volatile based on wind generation and demand
- **Negative pricing events** common during high-wind, low-demand periods (spring nights)

**Typical Patterns:**
- **Spring/Fall nights:** $10-20/MWh ($0.01-0.02/kWh) or negative
- **Summer peak hours (4-8 PM):** $50-150/MWh ($0.05-0.15/kWh)
- **Winter peak hours:** $40-100/MWh ($0.04-0.10/kWh)

**Export Revenue Potential:**
- Solar export during peak hours: $0.05-0.10/kWh
- Average annual value: $0.04-0.06/kWh
- Requires SPP market participation agreement

## 4. COMPARATIVE CONTEXT

### 4.1 National Comparison

**U.S. Average Industrial Rate (2024):** ~$0.08/kWh

**Oklahoma Position:**
- Typically **30-40% below national average**
- Competitive with Louisiana, Washington, Idaho (hydropower states)
- Significantly cheaper than California ($0.14-0.18/kWh), New York ($0.12-0.15/kWh)

**Why Oklahoma is Low-Cost:**
1. Abundant wind resources (2nd in nation)
2. Low-cost natural gas generation
3. Regulated market with cost-based rates
4. Low population density = lower infrastructure costs

---

### 4.2 Data Center Peer Comparison

**Typical Data Center Power Costs by Region:**

| Region | All-In Cost | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Oklahoma** | **$0.05-0.08/kWh** | **Lowest tier** |
| Texas (ERCOT) | $0.06-0.10/kWh | Deregulated, volatile |
| Iowa | $0.06-0.09/kWh | Wind-heavy |
| Virginia | $0.07-0.10/kWh | Data center hub |
| California | $0.14-0.20/kWh | Highest tier |

## 5. RATE NEGOTIATION OPPORTUNITIES

### 5.1 Custom Rate Tariffs

**For Large Loads (>5 MW):**
- Oklahoma utilities regularly negotiate **special contracts**
- Opportunity to reduce rates 10-20% below standard tariff
- Behind-the-meter generation (HB 1374 legislation) provides negotiating leverage

**From Project Analysis:**
- Saga's 7.4 MW IT load (~9.5 MW total facility) qualifies for custom rate
- On-site solar + BESS + generators strengthens negotiating position
- Potential structures:
  - Reduced demand charge (reflecting minimal grid dependency)
  - Time-of-use energy pricing
  - Enhanced demand response incentives

---

### 5.2 Demand Response Revenue

**PSO Peak Performers Program:**
- **$32/kW/year** enrolled capacity
- 6-12 events/year (June-September)
- Voluntary participation

**OG&E Load Reduction Program:**
- **$25-35/kW/year** (estimated)
- Performance-based incentives
- 6-10 events/year

**Value for Data Center with Microgrid:**
- 7,000 kW enrollment: $180,000-$224,000/year
- 100% load shedding capability (BESS + generators)
- No operational impact to customers

## 7. RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Rate Negotiations:

1. **Establish Baseline:** Request OG&E/PSO standard commercial tariffs for 9.5 MW load
   - Identify if demand charges apply
   - Confirm time-of-use rate availability

2. **Leverage BTM Generation:** Use HB 1374 (behind-the-meter) legislation as negotiating basis
   - Highlight 12 MW solar + BESS + generator capability
   - Propose reduced interconnection size (3-5 MW vs. 9.5 MW)

3. **Bundle Demand Response Commitment:** Offer 100% participation in DR programs
   - Negotiate enhanced $/kW incentive rate
   - Request multi-year rate lock (3-5 years)

4. **Target Rate:** **$0.04-0.06/kWh all-in** (energy + demand + riders)
   - Would represent 20-40% savings vs. standard industrial tariff
   - Justified by minimal grid dependency and firm DR capacity
