UPS equipment CAN be housed outdoors in weatherproof enclosures
    - Switch Las Vegas uses outdoor containerized enclosures with UPS inside
    - Weather-rated containers protect all electrical gear (~12 ft Ã— 55 ft per enclosure)
    - Temperature control provided within containers
  2. Your current design would work perfectly with outdoor enclosures:
    - 2N UPS systems: Put A-side UPS in one outdoor building, B-side in another
    - Switchboards: Already planned to be retained
    - Battery cabinets: Can be housed in outdoor enclosures with proper climate control
  3. Benefits of outdoor electrical buildings:
    - Reduced building footprint: Eliminates 6,000 SF of indoor electrical rooms
    - Shorter cable runs: Place outdoor enclosures on north side near generators
    - Better equipment separation: Clear electrical/mechanical zone separation
    - Easier expansion: Add more outdoor enclosures as you scale
    - Cost savings: Outdoor enclosures typically cheaper than building interior electrical rooms
