## Evaluate electrical rooms:
- **Configuration:** Traditional indoor electrical rooms (required for 2N UPS architecture) <!-- I believe we're going with outdoor electrical rooms -->

- **Size:** ~3,000 SF each (~6,000 SF total)
- **Location:** Adjacent to data hall for short cable runs
- **Equipment:** 2N modular UPS, switchboards, distribution panels
- **Fire Suppression:** Clean agent (FM-200 or Novec 1230) per NFPA 2001

- October architectural meeting discussed outdoor containerized electrical enclosures
- With BESS-as-UPS rejection, traditional indoor electrical rooms required for UPS equipment
- Indoor rooms provide climate control and fire protection for UPS systems
