# Email Draft: Camelot Task 3 Scope Expansion - GCP Interconnection

**Subject:** Request to Expand Task 3 Scope - GCP Interconnection Feasibility

Hi [Camelot Contact Name],

As we're preparing for our upcoming investor meeting, we'd like to clarify what's in your fiber analysis work under Task 3 (Ad Hoc Support) and get a quote to include a specific focus on **Google Cloud Platform interconnection feasibility**.

**Background:**
Our Pryor data center site is approximately **4 miles from Google's Pryor campus**, which presents a unique opportunity to offer customers direct, sub-millisecond connectivity to GCP via Dedicated Interconnect. This would be a significant competitive differentiator, but we need to validate technical and economic feasibility before the investor presentation.

**Requested Scope Expansion:**
In addition to the general fiber analysis already discussed, can we specifically assess:

1. **Fiber Route to Google Pryor Campus**
   - Identify existing dark fiber infrastructure between our site and Google Pryor campus
   - Map physically diverse route options (for redundancy)
   - Assess existing conduit availability (reduces installation costs)

2. **Service Options Analysis**
   - Dark fiber purchase vs. IRU lease vs. lit fiber service
   - Cost estimates for each option (installation + monthly recurring)
   - Lead time estimates (permitting, construction, activation)

3. **GCP Dedicated Interconnect Requirements**
   - Confirm single-mode fiber specs meet Google's requirements (10GBASE-LR or 100GBASE-LR4)
   - Identify fiber providers with existing connectivity to Google campus
   - Preliminary coordination requirements with Google

4. **Deliverable for Investor Package**
   - Route map showing fiber paths to Google campus
   - Cost/benefit summary (upfront investment vs. customer value proposition)
   - High-level timeline for Dedicated Interconnect deployment

**Timeline:**
We're targeting completion by **early November** to incorporate findings into our investor materials. We understand this is T&M workâ€”could you provide a quote and timeline estimate for this expanded scope?

Please let us know if you have questions or need additional context. Happy to schedule a quick call to discuss.

Regards,
