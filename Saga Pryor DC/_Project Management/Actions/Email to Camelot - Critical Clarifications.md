# Email to Camelot - Critical Clarifications

**Subject:** Urgent: Grid Parameters & GCP Fiber Analysis for Nov 7 Investor Meeting

---

Hi [Camelot Contact],

As we approach the investor meeting on **November 7**, we need to clarify a few critical items that are driving our strategic decisions. Our entire architecture and financial model hinge on the grid interconnection parameters from your Task 1 study.

## 1. Grid Connection Parameters

**Critical Questions:**
1. What is your **estimated cost range** for interconnection (line extension + substation upgrades)?
2. What is the **realistic timeline** from application through construction to energization?
3. Are there any **queue positions** or transmission constraints that could extend the timeline?

## 2. BESS Operating Mode Clarification
<!-- @claude Rewrite this to highlight the plan to use the BESS as the UPS. That's the main thing. Furthermore the BESS should work off grid and on-grid, so let's not worry about the distinction mainly -->

Your Task 2 scope describes modeling the BESS as a "front-of-meter AC-coupled BESS project interconnecting to the local utility."

**Our actual use case is different:**
- **Behind-the-meter** BESS (not exporting to grid)
- **Dual-mode operation:**
  - **Phase 0 (Months 0-12):** Off-grid microgrid (BESS captures solar excess + provides 1.5hr backup before generators start)
  - **Phase 1+ (Months 12+):** Grid-tied (BESS captures solar excess + provides backup during grid outages)

**Question:** Can your net load analysis accommodate this behind-the-meter, dual-mode configuration? Or is it focused solely on front-of-meter revenue stack?

**Impact:** We need to validate that 12-15 MWh BESS sizing makes sense for solar excess capture, not just revenue optimization.





Happy to schedule a quick call this week to discuss if that's easier than email.

Thanks for your partnership on this project!

Best regards,

[Your Name]
Saga Energy
