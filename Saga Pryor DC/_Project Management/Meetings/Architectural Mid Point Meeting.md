Oh, better than I deserve.

  

[@1:16](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=76.512) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Good to see your face. Thank you for all your hard work.

  

[@1:21](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=81.352) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

Really, really, really, really appreciate it.

  

[@1:23](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=83.392) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Thank you. Thank you.

  

[@1:27](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=87.172) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

Okay, so should I share my computer?

  

[@1:30](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=90.872) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yeah, please do.

  

[@1:33](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=93.812) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

You sound a little muffled.

  

[@1:35](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=95.572) - **Erik Stockglausner**

I don't know if you've got something over your microphone. Yeah, it's not a great mic situation.

  

[@1:43](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=103.252) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

I can still hear you.

  

[@1:44](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=104.652) - **Erik Stockglausner**

It just sounds like you're in a quiet room, maybe.

  

[@1:50](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=110.372) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

Okay, two seconds. I can switch here. Now?

  

[@1:57](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=117.592) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Better? Yeah, you're good. You're good. We can hear you. Okay. Yeah, no, you're good. You're good.

  

[@2:02](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=122.864) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

No, it's, it's fine.

  

[@2:06](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=126.164) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Trust me. We can hear you just fine. It might be the noise cancellation on your headphones. It's maybe causing it to sound a little muffled.

Like you're, I can still hear what you're saying. It just sounds like it's boom.

  

[@2:20](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=140.444) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Okay. There.

  

[@2:22](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=142.124) - **Erik Stockglausner**

That's better.

  

[@2:23](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=143.444) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah. Okay.

  

[@2:25](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=145.884) - **Erik Stockglausner**

What'd you do?

  

[@2:27](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=147.984) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Oh, right to the computer.

  

[@2:31](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=151.164) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

Ah, nice. I'm in here, but yeah. So, okay. I have been working. Ben did an introduction that is therapy, but here you go.

told her, I told her the only thing certain in life is change.

  

[@2:47](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=167.624) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

So, so here we go.

  

[@2:52](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=172.144) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Oh, better already.

  

[@2:54](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=174.584) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

I have been working internally on the rooms that we talk. Um, Bye. you. Erik, the last time, the lobby, all mantras, restrooms, culpits, beat me room.

I explained to Ben that I used this core space, what is the white space, mechanical room, electrical room. I used the dimensions that I received the first time, that layout.

So I respect the buffer zones, we have restrooms, and here we have the loading ducts with the shipping and receiving area, security area, restrooms.

  

[@3:44](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=224.736) - **Erik Stockglausner**

It's fantastic, right?

  

[@3:46](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=226.696) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Station. Awesome.

  

[@3:51](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=231.816) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

Yeah, so this will be the entrance and the back. So, you're On one side we have that, the internal.

So I separate the two models. So basically what this allowed is to work on one side on the architecture and I can update and this and it gets updated quickly here.

So for the implementation and then this is the other model that it has the site element. And I link another model with the solar panels because there are so many that it kills my computer.

But that would be the idea and then we can review, but I have been thinking on some. Let me move it here.

Oops. Let me ask you a question real quick.

  

[@4:59](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=299.348) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yep. Julia, the battery storage solution that we have there, you don't have do this now, but I'm wondering if it makes sense to rotate that 90 degrees to the left and put the trees on the other side.

The only reason I say that is because we're going to want to get, we're obviously going to want to get electricity or electrical cables between the substation and the battery system.

And just a thought, don't do anything now. And along with the concept of what we were talking about when we were thinking about leveraging the retention pond as maybe more of a kind of a moat around the facility, we're going to probably eliminate some of the infrastructure inside the building.

Okay. Because I think what we're going to do is we're going to create a battery, a BES system that allows us to leverage that entire system as a UPS for the whole building.

. So some of the batteries that's in there, the battery rooms, if you go up to the top there, I think what you have is the switchgear and batteries and UPSs in those rooms.

Yeah, electrical or mechanical? Yeah, I'm not sure what the mechanical rooms represent. Those might be mechanical switchboards. I'm not sure, but we'll still need all the electrical switchgear.

What we won't need is the batteries and UPS. Yeah, what's in there?

  

[@6:28](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=388.012) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

So those are UPSs right there. But didn't we still want to have space for the UPSs? I think we can.

  

[@6:36](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=396.612) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Well, I'm just saying for right now, we need to remove, we should remove it based on what the conversation we had.

We can figure out, we're not going to need near as much screen for UPSs and batteries, even if it climbs.

Yeah, here's where I'm thinking about.

  

[@6:50](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=410.692) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Before we talk about this, if we're going to 10 megawatts IT load, we just have to get bigger. Like this square footage.

It would not work at all. You know what I mean? Well, what's this footprint?

  

[@7:04](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=424.784) - **Erik Stockglausner**

5 megawatts?

  

[@7:08](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=428.224) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

7.4 was what it was. The footprint's big enough.

  

[@7:12](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=432.824) - **Erik Stockglausner**

You think so? We're going to increase the density.

  

[@7:17](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=437.404) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

The thought we agreed on yesterday was 10 megawatt and then increase the density to 20. That's what we were talking about over time.

  

[@7:28](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=448.144) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Oh, I see what you're saying because, well, if you, if you, we can go larger. think we need to just stretch it.

Well, we got to figure out where we're going to put it.

  

[@7:37](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=457.924) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

I think we can go wider. Yeah.

  

[@7:41](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=461.224) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Well, first things first, I think to avoid any confusion or to work within the space that we have, we can remove the UPSs.

We can remove the batteries. Are you going to give, should we give her a new line diagram though, with how we decided to do that?

  

[@7:59](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=479.664) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah.

  

[@8:00](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=480.256) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Well, we can, but I'm just trying to say that I don't know that she needs to do this right now, but the batteries and the UPSs can be removed.

We'll keep all the switchboards. So the SWBD. And if you want to create another version of this, however, if you want to keep this the way it is and create another version, I don't care.

I just, I don't, I don't want to come back later and go, oh, they decided to go back. Awesome.

the switchboards are going to be where the electricity is going to come into the building and then get distributed to the IT equipment.

The mechanical switchboards are going to be critical because, and I think we're going to organize this stuff differently. So that's what I'm saying.

Okay. That's what I'm saying.

  

[@8:41](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=521.116) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

Because we are going to have like way less equipment. If the UPS and all these batteries, we have more batteries here.

They are removed. So we will need way less space.

  

[@8:56](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=536.416) - **Erik Stockglausner**

We'll still have, we'll still have some, we'll still have a small battery cab. So the switchgear will need to have power continuously if there is a power outage, but for now, you're right.

What you're eliminating is the batteries and the UPSs. We're not going to need those. Okay, they're out, switchboard are in.

  

[@9:25](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=565.088) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

So what you have there is you've got the electrical rooms horizontally oriented.

  

[@9:29](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=569.288) - **Erik Stockglausner**

I think there might be a benefit in flipping them vertically oriented, and we can do that if we remove the UPSs and batteries.

  

[@9:38](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=578.448) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

Okay, perfect. Got it. But you don't have to do it now.

  

[@9:44](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=584.488) - **Erik Stockglausner**

I mean, we can set up another call. didn't mean to interrupt you, but go ahead and show us what else you need to show us.

  

[@9:51](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=591.448) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

Okay, so yeah, I was mentioned like these spaces, I respected from the layout. So so much. DONALD TRUMP I've

Regarding the landscape, I was thinking...

  

[@10:03](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=603.76) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Can tell me, real quick while you're there, can you tell me the square footage from the top left of that data hall to the bottom right?

Include the fan walls, too, in that calculation? Sure.

  

[@10:17](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=617.64) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

From here? Nope. Yep. No, that's the equipment rooms.

  

[@10:22](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=622.66) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Well, she's going to go down to the right, yeah? I guess maybe. You want the data hall? Yeah, that whole thing.

Okay. Let's go down, down, down. What are the... Maybe not... I don't know about the rightmost part. What's in that?

Yeah, that's fan wall. But just to the left, because I don't think we need this. Well, do we need that CDU?

That's part of the data hall, guess? Yeah. Okay, that right there. Yeah. How many square feet is that? It's 16 uh, 16....9.

16.9. So, if we want 20 20 MHz... I mean, I have a rough estimate that's saying that you want, I don't know if I trust it, though, 65,000 square feet?

That seems too high.

  

[@11:13](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=673.472) - **Erik Stockglausner**

So if we build it to 10 megawatts and 20,000 square feet of white space, we'll be at 500 watts a foot.

And that's dense but not super high dense. That's probably 10 kilowatts of cabinet, which is manageable, easily manageable. If we take that from 10 megawatts to 20, that's 1,000 watts a foot.

So now you're getting into where the rear door heat exchangers are going to really add value. Or we're going to go liquid to chip, right?

And if we go liquid to chip, it's even going be more dense. It's going to be 2,000 watts a foot.

So a good, a good ballpark, I think, for today's data center based on traditional air cooling is about 10, like,

Amazon's doing 17 kilowatts a cabinet, okay? So I think the size here is gonna need to get bigger. We wanna have, we wanna try to get to 20,000 square feet of what I call white space where the computers will go.

Okay. Okay? That doesn't all have to be fit out day one, but maybe two 10,000 square foot sections would allow us to be 5 megawatts in each 10,000 foot section.

  

[@12:39](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=759.824) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

You call the, sorry, I have that question. You call the white space to all this area? Like, I don't know, we have the fan walls.

  

[@12:50](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=770.784) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yeah, what white, what the, right now you've got white space and equipment rooms in there. So that's, see where it says white space there?

That room. went. Yeah, that room, it was going to be wider because we're not going to need the fan walls.

The fan walls, yeah, the fan walls count as white space.

  

[@13:08](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=788.196) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Everything else doesn't, though.

  

[@13:10](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=790.476) - **Erik Stockglausner**

No, the fan walls would not count as white space. Well, they're going away, right?

  

[@13:16](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=796.376) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yes, correct. Sorry.

  

[@13:18](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=798.896) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

So you're saying like the white space should be 20,000 square feet? Ideally, we want to be able to go to 20,000 square feet of white space alone.

  

[@13:30](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=810.836) - **Erik Stockglausner**

So the building is going to have to get bigger or it's going to have to go up. And it just kind of depends on what they want to do.

  

[@13:38](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=818.196) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

So right now, the space that we have.

  

[@13:47](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=827.856) - **Erik Stockglausner**

So this is where this is where it might make sense, Benton, to consider a two story design. I think, isn't it cheaper to build one?

  

[@13:59](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=839.856) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

go. building. it You use

  

[@14:01](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=841.708) - **Erik Stockglausner**

So, generally speaking, but if you're going to go ahead and build a roof that's FM-150 rated, you're going to have to have the structure to support it anyway.

That's true. So, you're going to have to have a beefier structure if you're going to go with an FM-rated roof.

If you go FM-150, you're going to have to have more structural steel to support it. And a two-story gives us a smaller footprint with the same or more capacity, plenty of white space and plenty of equipment room space.

So, that might be the model we go with if we're going to go to an FM-1-150. Because now I've got to create more, I've got to create enough, I've got to create enough structural support to be able to carry that heavier roof.

  

[@14:50](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=890.188) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Does that make sense? Makes perfect sense.

  

[@14:53](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=893.708) - **Erik Stockglausner**

If you go, you could go single-story, don't get me wrong, but if you're going to go ahead and, if you're going to go ahead and create a roof that will support, you know.

Yeah, mean, and then you don't need a bigger slab, so you can get the same size slab.

  

[@15:06](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=906.3) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

You've already got the structural steel to support a concrete roof, and then you just need...

  

[@15:12](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=912.42) - **Erik Stockglausner**

You're just going up a level. So there's two routes. There's expand it and consume some of the solar space that they have right now, right, which they may or may not want to do.

  

[@15:23](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=923.14) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

The solar is just so low value compared to data center space though. But I agree with you, but the owner is very sustainably conscious, so...

Totally.

  

[@15:35](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=935.52) - **Erik Stockglausner**

I think at some point they'll probably rip out half of the solar panels and put more data center there.

Yeah. But I don't want to necessarily destroy his sustainability thing right off the bat.

  

[@15:48](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=948.22) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Well, I mean, upgrading to another story gives you a lot more room really quickly. You know what I mean?

And I don't think we have... We don't have the footprint there to be able to just double the size of that building.

Correct.

  

[@16:05](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=965.412) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Even with the UPSs and battery cabinets removed. And then that doesn't leave any room if the customer says we do want a UPS for some of these systems.

Got it.

  

[@16:14](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=974.312) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Do you have a good indication as to what the exterior sizing of stuff that will need to be as we try to fit it there?

Equipment yards.

  

[@16:24](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=984.032) - **Erik Stockglausner**

So all the critical spaces, which the critical space is defined as the electric rooms, all the switch rooms, any areas where critical equipment is going into, including outside the equipment yard, it's usually going to be double whatever the white space is in this scenario.

So if we do 20,000 square foot of white space, let's say it's 10 up and 10 down.

  

[@16:52](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1012.87) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

if you're doubling it, I mean, you're, you get, you're going to get 30 in this. Correct.

  

[@16:59](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1019.23) - **Erik Stockglausner**

So what I'm saying is though. We need to account for the equipment that's going to go outside, but I think if you go two-story, that reinforces even more so, giving us more real estate outside for the equipment yards.

Yeah, I think that's a good point.

  

[@17:15](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1035.08) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

I mean, I had the AI pull some example sizes of things like generator yard, best yard, that kind of stuff.

I don't know how accurate it is, but...

  

[@17:24](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1044.92) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Well, don't include the best because that's already on a separate parcel. Is it?

  

[@17:30](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1050.54) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah, this is what we're talking about.

  

[@17:32](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1052.58) - **Erik Stockglausner**

This building doesn't have best in anywhere on that plot. No, no, I know that.

  

[@17:36](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1056.22) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

I'm talking about like the stuff outside this building right now. We're just seeing like, what, like, could we make the building bigger based on the fact that we're using more, like, I think Julia just drew a box and put batteries in it.

But I don't know, I don't know if we've thought about what the actual size of that box is for generators and batteries and other things that's on the, you know what mean?

Well, what she has there there is... Thank

  

[@18:00](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1080.58) - **Erik Stockglausner**

So that's not the best system. If you scroll out to the site view again, the best system is right next to the substation.

Back up? Yeah, yeah. It's big, though.

  

[@18:08](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1088.78) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah, but it's not the land that we're building on. Yeah. See, the best system is separate.

  

[@18:14](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1094.22) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yeah, but we're moving the pond.

  

[@18:15](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1095.76) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Sorry. I'm thinking about if we put the pond at the bottom, we can expand the data center out. Yes.

  

[@18:23](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1103.68) - **Erik Stockglausner**

And if we make the pond look more like a horseshoe, serves dual purposes and we can get more realistic.

So where I would put the pond is I would distribute the pond between the, I guess the bottom is south.

Yeah, yeah. I would make the pond kind of go around that outside corner, that south east corner. Yeah, here, like here.

  

[@18:50](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1130.74) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

There and up.

  

[@18:51](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1131.7) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Oh, I'll go up.

  

[@18:55](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1135.48) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

Like this? Yeah, yeah.

  

[@18:58](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1138.18) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Okay. And then you, then what that does is it gives you room to. Yeah.

  

[@19:02](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1142.69) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

And how many, how many square feet is the battery yard there?

  

[@19:08](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1148.25) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

This battery yard, I took it from Saga's layout. So, um, I'm not sure if this footage is, um, it's activated.

Yeah. Okay. I think they just did one of these, like the pencil.

  

[@19:27](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1167.85) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

40,000. That seems way more than necessary.

  

[@19:32](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1172.09) - **Erik Stockglausner**

I don't know how much of those dimensions on those VES cabinets are pretty accurate, but I would, we could have AI pull up, you know, what the mega pack sizes are and how many would be required.

But again, that's a section there that we could squeeze into the same, you know, the width between the boundary of the property and where we start the boundary for the data center build.

You know, I think if we, if we turn, we could probably put the best in that narrative. We're probably going to need 50,000 square feet if that's 40 because there's going to be some extra equipment and maybe more batteries to support what they're looking for.

  

[@20:12](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1212.3) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah, I think that's about double what we need in those because you got inverters and BESS and I did the quick math on it with, I mean, I'm just making up with GPT, right?

But it's saying you need 10, 20 by 8 footprints to do the inverters, plus there's some other stuff in there, so call it 12.

So if you had, right now, there's one tooth, scroll up a little bit, Julia.

  

[@20:38](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1238.18) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

Yeah, sorry. Yeah, so you see all those boxes?

  

[@20:42](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1242.64) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

We basically need 12 of those. Yeah. Okay, double these ones. Yeah, that's what I'm guessing. And I think that, what size are those boxes?

  

[@20:54](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1254.96) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

This one is like a container of 40 feet. 40 feet. 40 feet.

  

[@21:00](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1260.67) - **Erik Stockglausner**

It's going to be 40 by 8, so add, you're probably going to add 6 feet on each side.

  

[@21:08](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1268.61) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah, 20 by 8 is what it was saying was the size of these containers for the. Okay.

  

[@21:17](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1277.19) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

I think I have a, okay.

  

[@21:20](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1280.23) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

But I would, let me confirm that before we make changes to this.

  

[@21:24](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1284.55) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

Sure.

  

[@21:25](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1285.71) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Before you go and spend a lot of time, I'll try to get, they'll know this too. They've actually installed best units.

So did you take these container sizes from them?

  

[@21:34](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1294.55) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

Uh, no, I just, I, yeah, I thought that was, I thought that was their design.

  

[@21:43](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1303.41) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yeah, no, no, no.

  

[@21:45](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1305.07) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

This one, no.

  

[@21:46](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1306.93) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Okay. Yeah.

  

[@21:48](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1308.59) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

I think, I think we'll get half of that space back. Which means you could put the data center on one level.

To hit our goals. I don't know how to do that calculation between one level and two level as far as cost of building goes.

  

[@22:08](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1328.64) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yeah, what you'd have to do is say, I'm constructing a, call it, call it a… I could prompt it, but yeah.

A hundred thousand square foot building or a two-story, fifty thousand square foot, two-story. Yeah. We're going to be building to an FM 1-150 roof rating.

What's the difference in cost to build one structure versus the other? Yeah. Because it's going to give you a cost per foot, like, to construct the building of, say, 120 bucks a foot.

And they say, well, if you go two-story, that's going to be 160 bucks.

  

[@22:43](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1363.0) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah, exactly. Or, hopefully, it'll give you a per square foot rating cost, probably. I'll do that math. And then I'll double check with them on their best sizing.

And then we can… Let's how much we can get in there. All right. What else? So right now, where is pooling?

We have gens on the top. So go back into the, scroll into the data center zone there. Thank you, Julia, for humoring us.

This is great. This is awesome.

  

[@23:20](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1400.98) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Awesome. These are your gens at the top left, right?

  

[@23:25](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1405.62) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

Top left. Yeah, two, three, four, I think, I think we'll have five.

  

[@23:34](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1414.18) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

So that's perfect. And then having an extra one, I don't know.

  

[@23:40](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1420.54) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

So you're only going to need one of those small gens.

  

[@23:43](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1423.46) - **Erik Stockglausner**

That's going to be for office areas. You're not going to need two. Okay. You can delete one of those if you want.

  

[@23:54](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1434.06) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

And obviously we don't have, like, we'll be buying these as we need them.

  

[@24:06](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1446.77) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

Can we have these generators in the same area, these ones, or these are conformers? I don't know. I'm not sure, but all the equipment in the same side?

  

[@24:24](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1464.65) - **Erik Stockglausner**

So you're going to have chillers on one side, and I would line them up horizontally versus vertically. Yeah, so it's like this.

  

[@24:36](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1476.37) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

Yeah, there you go.

  

[@24:37](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1477.97) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

There you go.

  

[@24:39](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1479.61) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

Okay, so we have three of these ones. And clearance between them? I'd say eight feet max.

  

[@24:48](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1488.27) - **Erik Stockglausner**

You want to make sure you have plenty of airflow, plus you want to be able to get in and maintain the equipment.

So, you know, eight feet minimum, right? Yeah, feet minimum, eight feet minimum, yeah. You can do ten.

  

[@25:09](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1509.66) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

And then we have these ones that in one layout, we have three. In the other one, we have five.

So I keep five, but I don't know what are those?

  

[@25:26](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1526.62) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Those are the idiotic. Those are the idiotic ones, which we are removing. We're going to have the dual chillers.

don't know how many we're going to need. Oh, so wait a minute.

  

[@25:33](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1533.62) - **Erik Stockglausner**

So what you got right there, those things down below, that's a perfect symbol to use for the chiller because it's going to look identical to that.

You see the symbol down below that's got the little fans on it? No.

  

[@25:45](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1545.26) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

Yeah, those. Sorry, these ones.

  

[@25:47](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1547.1) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yep. Yeah.

  

[@25:47](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1547.96) - **Erik Stockglausner**

That's exactly what the chiller is going to look like. It might be a little different size, but maybe the ones up there.

Yeah, there you go. It's chiller one, two, three. There you go. Perfect. These are the chiller. Yeah. Yeah.

  

[@25:56](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1556.54) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

I don't know what to say. The ADs are the adiabatic, the evaporative cooling ones. Those are chiller. Those are going away.

But we're going to add more other chillers. I will take an action to give you the count of chillers.

  

[@26:09](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1569.61) - **Erik Stockglausner**

So for a 20 megawatt data center, you're going to need, if we assume a 1.5 megawatt chiller, so 20 divided by 1.5 equals, that's 13, so 14 at n plus 2, that puts a set for two different phases, n plus 1 each phase.

14, 15, so 30. No, no, take that back. 14, 16. Yeah, 16 of them.

  

[@26:42](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1602.71) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

16, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9.

  

[@26:51](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1611.55) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

You can just two rows of 8 is what you're probably going to need to do.

  

[@26:53](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1613.85) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Exactly. Well, no, no, no, no, no.

  

[@26:56](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1616.07) - **Erik Stockglausner**

When we, if we, if we design, we'll do two rows of 8. If we have to. But if we make the building longer, like you suggested, we might be able to stack them all on one side of the building, like Switch did, and put the other switch gear on.

You can put all the switch gear and electrical rooms outside.

  

[@27:14](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1634.14) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah, where's the meet-me room? We have two.

  

[@27:20](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1640.4) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

We have one here and one in the south and north area.

  

[@27:26](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1646.4) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

I guess this is the room where the GCP will come into, where all the fiber, like that stuff. Would it come in from the north or the south, or does it matter?

It's got to come in diversely. Okay, so we want two of them? Yep, absolutely.

  

[@27:43](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1663.98) - **Erik Stockglausner**

They should ideally be about the same size. Oh, okay.

  

[@27:48](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1668.44) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

So what's that meet-me room at right now, square footage-wise? I know we're going to change it, but I'm just curious what we're looking at.

250.

  

[@28:00](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1680.38) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

200. I don't know if these square feet, yeah, this one and this one, it could be a little bit more or 300, but ideally that's good to know they have to be, how many, how many racks would go in there, Erik?

  

[@28:27](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1707.52) - **Erik Stockglausner**

So if you're going to do, in the first phase, we're going to deploy this.

  

[@28:33](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1713.8) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Do you want it inside the security? It's the highest security, right? Yes. Okay. The Meet Me Room. Yeah, Meet Me Room is basically like, it's a networking room.

It's where all of the outside connectivity comes into the building. It's weird because it's not like a meeting room for people.

It's a place for computers to hang out. Yeah.

  

[@29:02](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1742.87) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

So, I imagine, so if we enter from, yeah, if we enter, but I have this question because I saw it in other data centers.

If the door, if we enter from inside, it is okay? It's not the... I think so.

  

[@29:20](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1760.43) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

That looks good to me. Okay.

  

[@29:23](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1763.65) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

It's not, yeah, okay. Regarding security... Yeah, yeah, exactly.

  

[@29:33](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1773.03) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

You got it. I'm going to show you something here in a second, Julia.

  

[@29:37](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1777.07) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Let me pull it up here in minute, if can the right one.

  

[@29:45](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1785.91) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

Because in the center, it was Switch, I think.

  

[@29:54](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1794.09) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Mm-hmm. Is Switch one had it opening to the outside?-bye. Bye Bye Bye-bye.-bye. Bye-bye.-bye. Thank you.

  

[@30:02](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1802.7) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

Yeah, well, probably, you know, they have, like, the mantra here, Meet Me Room. It is in here. Is MMC Meet Me Room, you think?

  

[@30:19](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1819.88) - **Erik Stockglausner**

MMC. Yeah, yeah, probably because there's rack pictures in Oh, you're looking at Switch.

  

[@30:24](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1824.42) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Okay, perfect. There you go.

  

[@30:25](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1825.82) - **Erik Stockglausner**

That's what I was trying to pull up. So this is a really good example. If you scroll out, you'll see where the mechanical equipment.

So you see all the equipment along the bottom? This one. Yeah, those are all chillers. Now, this is 48 megawatts.

This is 48 megawatts. They just have a bigger chiller. Yeah, so it's going to be half, you know, a little less than half of the size of this one.

But this is the ideal setup right here. This is showing you exactly how we want to lay it out.

We want all the mechanical equipment on one side of the building, all the electrical, all the electrical. Very The would be on the opposite side.

See there? If you scroll into there, you'll see those are the electrical switch rooms. Each one of those is an electrical switch room.

  

[@31:13](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1873.45) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

This is a better design.

  

[@31:15](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1875.63) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah, it's just much easier.

  

[@31:18](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1878.17) - **Erik Stockglausner**

It's a much better design. Yeah, that's why I was like, that's what we might be working from. Something like this would be easier for her to kind of morph.

Let's see here. We should just give you this and say, just copy this.

  

[@31:35](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1895.43) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah, yeah.

  

[@31:36](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1896.15) - **Erik Stockglausner**

I'm like, seriously, I mean, let's make it really easy for her because if we get the right footprint of the building, then it makes it a lot easier.

I'll open down. I assume they would have gone up if it was cheaper. It's cheaper to do, but they don't, they're, this is not, they're not, they're not putting an FM1.

  

[@31:56](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1916.77) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

That's true. I'll, I'll do that calculation. So I'll share this with you here. Thank you. Thank

  

[@32:02](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1922.16) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Okay, so if you look here, if I scroll in, you'll see on this drawing, this is the entire data center, right?

This is for Las Vegas. This is 48 megawatts. And so you got 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24 chillers.

So we're going to need, I think what we said was, let me say 16 total. Uh, 8 and 8 for each 10 megawatt phase.

If we go that level and this up here, these are the chillers. I'm sorry. Those are the electrical rooms.

These are the electrical rooms. I apologize.

  

[@32:42](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1962.96) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah. Yeah. Uh, these are the generators.

  

[@32:49](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=1969.5) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yes. I'm not mistaken, I think those are generators. Yeah. Okay. This is the NV switch here. Um, this is the data hall, right?

And the building envelope is this entire long thing here, right? This is the chillers up here, right? You got the chiller, you got the piping, you got the buffer vessel, right?

Okay. And this is the chill water piping comes in, then you have the CDU gallery. So you have just, this is a little gallery where all the equipment comes in before it goes into the white space.

This here's the white space. Okay. This is probably the meet me room or one of the meeting rooms on this end of the building.

I go to the other end of the, or that might be, it's not going to be that security. I go to the other end of the building.

There's probably going to be a meet me room over here too. Yeah, this looks like the loading, where's the loading dock at though?

Maybe it's not in this drawing.

  

[@33:49](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2029.54) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

It should be on the building.

  

[@33:53](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2033.66) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Oh, here's the loading dock. It's here. Exactly. Yeah. I don't know if that's even the loading dock. No, no, no.

Okay. Okay. from Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Here's the loading dock. So I'm not sure what this area is, but that one is the trash enclosure.

  

[@34:12](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2052.89) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

The what?

  

[@34:14](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2054.61) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Trash enclosure. Oh, trash. OK. There you go. Yeah. So this is the kind of the design we want. We want, you know, some office areas on one side and or a loading dock and a few office areas.

And then over here, you know, where's their facilities knock kind of oversight room?

  

[@34:35](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2075.11) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Is it in one of the one of the sides? Yeah, it's going to be on one of the sides.

  

[@34:38](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2078.75) - **Erik Stockglausner**

But that's why I was saying if you split the building down the middle, you could create a knock in the middle and a mezzanine and you could look down over either side if you wanted to.

You could actually create like a running track around the top so that you could walk around and look down.

If you if we can fit it into one level. Right. If you could fit into one level. And I do think it's going to.

It more than likely less expensive to do one level, even with an FM 1-150.

  

[@35:09](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2109.36) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

I'd rather do one level because it makes it simpler.

  

[@35:11](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2111.92) - **Erik Stockglausner**

All the equipment lines up perfectly. All the electrical distances are nice and short, so it keeps our costs down.

Copper costs a lot of money.

  

[@35:20](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2120.82) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah. I mean, this design is just dead simple, but perfect. It's perfect. This design is great.

  

[@35:27](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2127.5) - **Erik Stockglausner**

We just need it smaller. And then, this has even got what looks like rear door heat exchanger, but it's really not.

This is a different type of design, but...

  

[@35:39](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2139.86) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

When we do rear door, Erik, when we do rear door heat exchange, do we need to have a drop ceiling or something for like, how do we heat and cool the space?

we just do normal cry units on the roof?

  

[@35:52](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2152.0) - **Erik Stockglausner**

So what they will do in this design, since all the cooling is close coupled to the compute, this is liquid to chip.

  

[@35:59](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2159.58) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

All All they've done is they put...

  

[@36:01](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2161.15) - **Erik Stockglausner**

in some split systems and some small air conditioning areas, some dehumidification and things in the overall building for comfort cooling, because all the compute is cooled like in a refrigerator.

  

[@36:12](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2172.15) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Right. Okay. Yeah, but you would still, yeah, exactly. You still need humidity and air quality control with like good Merv and all that stuff.

  

[@36:19](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2179.15) - **Erik Stockglausner**

So, and you still want the inside of the data hall to be over pressure relative to the outside. So there might be an air handling unit on the roof that will, will provide that.

That's probably the simplest way to do it is an air handling unit and N plus one. We have two air handling units.

Either one can supply the unit. On each side, we can have like a half.

  

[@36:37](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2197.73) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

I mean, I'm thinking if we divide this thing in half, half sits like totally, not vacant, but you know, basically minimum fit out.

And then the right side, we install whatever, maybe it's like one, two, three, four, four blocks.

  

[@36:53](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2213.81) - **Erik Stockglausner**

So ideally, each half of the building, if we're going to break it up into two halves. We'll have half of the building.

We might. We'll truck the entire building day one. We'll leave half of it empty. We'll provide enough comfort cooling to support half of the building and the office areas.

And then we'll add the remaining comfort cooling when we build out the second phase. Yep.

  

[@37:20](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2240.28) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

And then on the second phase, would we literally leave it like shell, like just floor, nothing? Yeah. And then we would just have like chiller yard, but not a single chiller.

Like we don't need to wire or do anything. It's just like totally white space. Not a great word for that.

Totally undeveloped, semi-developed, shell-developed. Yep.

  

[@37:43](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2263.34) - **Erik Stockglausner**

So the way I would, and after thinking about our design parameter, 12 megawatts is probably going to be the good dividing point.

  

[@37:53](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2273.7) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

I spent about an hour last night on that and 12 megawatts is what I came up with because the gen sets are all 4.3.

You think your POE fluctuates. liked 12 megawatts seems like the perfect interior size for this one, because you can have three megawatt IT load blocks.

Yep.

  

[@38:13](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2293.14) - **Erik Stockglausner**

So that's the way I would build it out. I would probably build it out like Muhammad had designed, where it's the ring bus architecture MB, and the rings would be self-healing and automated, so people wouldn't really have to touch that stuff at all.

Brilliant. All right.

  

[@38:29](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2309.2) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

can translate this for you, Julia. Yeah.

  

[@38:32](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2312.16) - **Erik Stockglausner**

And then a three megawatt block. Just go build that, please. So a three megawatt block in a three megawatt block, we're going to need approximately four and a half.

On the chillers, we're going to need three per three megawatt block at 1.5 KW or 1.5 megawatts each. So that gives us N plus one on the chillers.

  

[@38:57](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2337.24) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Do you think each of these chillers are 1.5? Is that like a standard size? These are probably gonna be bigger.

  

[@39:04](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2344.63) - **Erik Stockglausner**

These are probably about, let's see if it's 48 megawatts, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, I think there's, yeah, yeah, sorry.

Are they numbered? Can you zoom in? I'm right now. It's hard to see any numbers on them because of the- No, no, it's not, I thought that might be a number.

  

[@39:31](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2371.59) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah. Let's number them.

  

[@39:34](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2374.43) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Let's see, 11, 12, 12, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 24, 22, 23, 24. 24, 2 megawatts.

  

[@39:48](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2388.15) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah.

  

[@39:49](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2389.47) - **Erik Stockglausner**

But you have to have more than enough chiller capacity for 48, so that's gonna be even more than two megawatts because- Yeah.

N plus water, N plus two. Two or three. So if there's 24 times 2 megawatts, that gives us enough cooling for the compute, I guess.

It was 48 megawatts compute, not facility?

  

[@40:14](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2414.88) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

That's a good question.

  

[@40:15](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2415.96) - **Erik Stockglausner**

I don't know. It might be 48 megawatts of utility.

  

[@40:21](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2421.18) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Whatever. Okay. I mean, we're doing, so if we're doing 3 megawatt blocks, having two chillers plus an extra is all we need to start for each block.

And then if you have two blocks, we have six of IT load. Can you get away with five chillers?

You just need one extra for those two blocks? Potentially, but that would be dependent on the customer.

  

[@40:45](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2445.28) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Customer might say, I want my own. don't want to share somebody else's chiller. I want my own 3 megawatt isolated block.

Okay.

  

[@40:52](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2452.66) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

But we can figure that out later. We could just base it there for four. Four. Four chillers. Sorry. Three chillers per.

Yep.

  

[@41:05](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2465.15) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Now, what that does to Benton is if we do three chillers per block and they double the density, you could extend and you can get those chillers out.

So we would build out the first three megawatt block, the second three megawatt block, the third three megawatt block, you could leave blank spaces for future liquid cooling capacity.

So, in other words, you'd have three for the first phase and you might leave this one blank. Then another three for the next phase, leave this one blank.

The reason why you would do that is because if you want to come back and because you're gonna have to come back and add chiller capacity when you increase your density.

Then you can stick a three megawatt chiller, right? Well, you just add, you add a dedicated chiller, or you could leave two spaces.

You know, my point being is that you want to leave one for expansion.

  

[@41:55](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2515.17) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

What I'm saying is like, so you have a little chiller like this, right? This is a one and a half megawatt chiller.

You leave one space here. You just put And a three megawatt chiller when you add AI is in you know, I don't know if they have a three megawatt chiller, you want to keep down the sizes as consistent as possible.

  

[@42:08](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2528.88) - **Erik Stockglausner**

So we want to standardize.

  

[@42:12](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2532.86) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Well, that's what I'm saying.

  

[@42:14](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2534.02) - **Erik Stockglausner**

But what we do when we double in density, double the density of it. You just need to leave enough empty space for the dedicated direct chip cooling chillers.

Mm hmm.

  

[@42:28](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2548.58) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

But you, in an ideal world, you have all the same model, same type of chiller, regardless. Okay. Can you see on this square footage?

Like, can you guesstimate what it would be? Like how much space, like how many feet is between two of those chillers?

I'm more interested in what the white space is, but...

  

[@42:49](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2569.88) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yeah, yeah, we can look at that, too.

  

[@42:52](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2572.16) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

It's gonna be two feet wide, I'm guessing, too. No, you're, you're driving not, Julia. That's right. That's right.

  

[@43:05](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2585.18) - **Erik Stockglausner**

So it's about 40 feet, so the overall, this is going to be about maybe 60 feet, I guess.

  

[@43:13](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2593.96) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Julia, if you were to plug this in, could you get a square feet rough calculation based on the sizing here?

  

[@43:22](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2602.94) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yes.

  

[@43:23](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2603.76) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

Do you have the card link or is it just a PDF? It's just a PDF.

  

[@43:32](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2612.1) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Okay.

  

[@43:34](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2614.08) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

Let me...

  

[@43:35](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2615.2) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

No, there was some easy way to look at the... Yeah. want for the white space?

  

[@43:42](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2622.76) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yeah. Okay.

  

[@43:45](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2625.74) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

Yeah, I have it here. I have the PDF that is calibrated, so I can take dimensions. So it's 88 by...

All that space, 88. ... ... ... Thank you. I for 58, 458, 458 equals 40,000 square feet, right?

  

[@44:16](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2656.59) - **Erik Stockglausner**

88, 458 equals 40,000 square feet. That's 40 megawatts, 48 megawatts. So it's over a thousand watts a foot. Now they're dense.

This is liquid cooled.

  

[@44:29](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2669.27) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah.

  

[@44:30](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2670.51) - **Erik Stockglausner**

So we probably want, we want about 40,000 square feet of white space for, for, um, for 20 megawatts. Yeah.

Cause we're going to be, yeah, we'll give us, so 40,000 square feet of white space would allow us to go to 24 megawatts pretty easily.

So do you. We want to try to build the first, the first white space area will be 20,000, second white space, second half of the building another 20,000, but we want to, we want to design it very similar to this.

Perfect.

  

[@45:19](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2719.02) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

So dimensional equipment, it would be very, very similar to this one, but it's like half of the white space.

  

[@45:26](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2726.16) - **Erik Stockglausner**

It's going to be blank. Yep. It's going to be empty. This half of the building will not exist or it'll be empty and we'll, we'll build this half first and we'll, we'll have the building constructed, but it'll all be open.

Exactly. Okay.

  

[@45:40](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2740.9) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

It will exist, but it's going to be empty. Yeah.

  

[@45:43](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2743.64) - **Erik Stockglausner**

We want to build it. We want to build the corn shell complete day one. And then what we want to do is ideally, if we want to put that knock in the middle and that would, that would be fitted out as part of the first phase.

We'd have the office space, we'd out as part of the first phase and we'd At the loading dock, all that would be done, the part that wouldn't, the part that would be empty essentially would be this part right here.

Okay. Nothing's going to be in there, nothing will be in the equipment yard, so all the equipment will be here.

  

[@46:16](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2776.03) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

We'll just draw it all, but then like gray it out for them, you know what I mean, so they see the whole thing.

  

[@46:20](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2780.23) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yeah, and then the pond should kind of go around like that, or something along those lines.

  

[@46:28](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2788.55) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Remember the road is going to come in, the road is going to come in from the right side. However you guys want to put it, it should kind of wrap around the building a little bit.

  

[@46:37](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2797.67) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Maybe not that big. You know, maybe it's, you're building a lake.

  

[@46:44](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2804.25) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Maybe it's more like that or something.

  

[@46:47](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2807.27) - **Erik Stockglausner**

All right. Okay.

  

[@46:50](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2810.59) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Julia, can you, can you pull up the site real quick? You have the site.

  

[@46:56](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2816.37) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yeah, and the BES system is going to be like. I don't I don't The systems could be along the north end, which I don't have a really good way to show it, but more horizontal like that.

  

[@47:10](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2830.6) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

What is that? The battery?

  

[@47:12](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2832.12) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

The battery storage?

  

[@47:13](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2833.14) - **Erik Stockglausner**

batteries. And then the substation will be like, you know, the substation will be like, I don't know why it's not going to be drawn.

You need like what?

  

[@47:23](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2843.9) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

For this data center, we want at least like 30 spots probably. The substation is going to look like something like this.

  

[@47:31](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2851.7) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Okay. Got it.

  

[@47:34](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2854.5) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

Yeah. How many of those containers are we going to need for the battery storage? Let me let me take that to tell you.

  

[@47:45](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2865.12) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Okay. Because we're big. We just got bigger. But if they're going to build this, it might as well be optimal.

Here's the good news.

  

[@48:00](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2880.26) - **Erik Stockglausner**

The building can be relatively small. We need the equipment yard space. Yeah. The building doesn't have to be very big.

So we want to have the electrical gear as close to the battery system as possible. So maybe the electrical gear goes on the top and the chillers go along the bottom.

Okay.

  

[@48:21](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2901.58) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

This building feels like the other one feels like there's a lot more internal strange space.

  

[@48:28](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2908.86) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yeah, we don't have that here because all the electrical mechanical equipment is outside.

  

[@48:36](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2916.84) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

So the electrical rooms that we have in here, they are outside. They have an enclosure. They are outdoor without a roof.

have concrete walls or they have a roof?

  

[@48:52](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2932.84) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Think of a storage container with all the electrical equipment inside of it. Ah, okay. Perfect.

  

[@48:57](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2937.6) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

And they will be similar size to these ones. Yep. Thank you. Thanks, everybody!

  

[@49:01](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2941.57) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Okay, probably virtually identical. Wait, these, those are actually little buildings?

  

[@49:08](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2948.53) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah.

  

[@49:09](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2949.65) - **Erik Stockglausner**

See the doors?

  

[@49:11](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2951.17) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

I can give you the size, so. That makes sense.

  

[@49:16](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2956.81) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

That makes sense.

  

[@49:19](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2959.63) - **Erik Stockglausner**

You might need two of these, but not a third. That's so much easier.

  

[@49:25](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2965.21) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

They are 12 by 55. Sure.

  

[@49:34](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=2974.91) - **Erik Stockglausner**

12 by 55. Okay. I'm pretty sure these are your generators. I'm pretty sure those are your generator. Generators will come in closed, too.

So the generators will have, will sit on a belly tank. The other one was just practice, Julia.

  

[@50:04](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3004.68) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

We had a big meeting with them yesterday, and we basically framed for them, we're like, look, your data center at full capacity is around 20% green.

You know what I mean? And so you were marketing this as a green data center, but at the end of the day, it's got some solar, but it's not a green data center.

And so if you increase the size, you're going to make a lot more money, and it's still going to be about as equally green, you know what I mean?

And so that was where they were like, oh, okay, I got it. You know, let's optimize for the ROI here.

  

[@50:42](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3042.84) - **Erik Stockglausner**

So I'll try to give you an actual share, where is it, just so let me try. Generators.

  

[@50:55](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3055.12) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

I'm trying to figure that out to see.

  

[@50:57](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3057.16) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Oh, was nice, though. It's like that when I got... I'm it out. I'm Let's try to get you the electrical, it's an AVK document.

Okay, this is what goes inside the enclosure, but it's the generator itself. Let me see if they show any dimensions.

I was tinkering with AI, I was plugging a bunch of this stuff in so we can get some more realistic.

Okay, dimensions. Okay.

  

[@52:03](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3123.24) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Are most of these things mobile, relatively? You can just put them on a truck and roll them out? Yeah, for the most part.

They come on a truck.

  

[@52:10](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3130.84) - **Erik Stockglausner**

You have to put the fluid coolers in stop, come later, the radiator, basically. But I was trying to see if I had a better picture.

We have an actual enclosure itself.

  

[@52:47](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3167.16) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

What is on the side that... There's the fluid. Yeah, that's the radiator that goes on top of the generator.

  

[@52:56](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3176.32) - **Erik Stockglausner**

I don't why it doesn't give us a picture. I should show the enclosure, but it didn't show it, because it's just the details on the gen generator.

I got some photographs of them. I know I did, but... Are you just looking for a generator? Well, was looking for the exact one, probably one that's going to be almost identical to the one we would use.

  

[@53:38](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3218.54) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

I mean, this is what the Dragon guy sent me for a turbine. Oh, yeah, you're looking, that's right.

  

[@53:42](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3222.66) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yeah, you're going to be talking, yeah, this is if we were to use reciprocating. Yeah. Let's see if there's a better picture than that.

  

[@53:52](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3232.5) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

This was the turbine he sent me. Yeah, won't need near as many generators if we use turbines.

  

[@53:57](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3237.14) - **Erik Stockglausner**

They're 4.3 They're 4.3 megawatts.

  

[@54:01](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3241.62) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

... ... I don't think that's actually what you can count on them. There's some, yeah, whatever number, but when I was kind of trying to size it last night, I assume that, I don't know if they leave it in the truck or they just trailer or they just drop, drop it on the ground.

Depends.

  

[@54:17](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3257.41) - **Erik Stockglausner**

They might just bring something like that on the truck for a temporary power, bridge power, we can call it.

Well, if they're running your turbine, I don't know.

  

[@54:27](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3267.57) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah, it's just bridge power. Turbines though, do you understand them to be cheaper? They're probably more expensive to buy.

So they're, they take longer to pay off, right? But they're cheaper to operate. Is that what they are?

  

[@54:49](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3289.93) - **Erik Stockglausner**

They're more efficient from a fuel perspective. they use those fuel.

  

[@54:53](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3293.65) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Right. If we're assuming we're grid powered day one, then we're just going to have emergency generate. So like turbine, turbine may not be worth the money if you have good power day one.

Because by the time we get this data center built, I assume they would have been able to get their connection set up.

So this is the, this is the, this is the Frankfurt data center.

  

[@55:22](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3322.08) - **Erik Stockglausner**

And these are the generators that are the typical diesel generators right here. So you got a little electrical room here and the generators inside, generators inside this area right here.

Right. And so you're taking power and you're feeding the MV switch room. This is a different building obviously.

  

[@55:43](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3343.92) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah. That's how that works. So Eric, let me borrow your brain for a second then. So if we have phase one, which is three megawatts, which means it's 90 plus percent powered by solar.

However, yes. Sizing. You would not want to pay for all that best capacity. So I have, I just wrote a memo on this.

I'll send it to you, but bear with me for a second. It doesn't make sense to size your best to fully capture every bit of solar for a year or less, because as soon as you up to that next block, it's going to consume all your solar.

And then you're going to be in that sweet zone for best. And you're also going to get at full capacity, at least an hour on that best as your UPS.

So the 16 megawatt best sizing seemed to be optimal. If you were to oversize it, then you're going to need to spend a lot more on best for just one year.

But the question I have now is, would you want to get that turbine because you're going to be running that turbine every night for four to six hours or however many hours it is for a year.

So in that regard, you're going to use a lot less fuel. Does it make sense to have one turbine to take care of phase one and then just all.

Yeah.

  

[@57:05](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3425.22) - **Erik Stockglausner**

So very good point. And I think you're onto something there. So many customers are going to struggle with the idea of having one generator.

They like the comfort of having their own.

  

[@57:21](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3441.9) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

You could have a turbine and the gens. You're going to need the n plus one anyways, but the turbine is just there to like, you're going to run that little sucker every night.

Right. And so like, it's, it'll pay it up, pay itself off because of its efficiency. And you can use a mobile unit like the one on wheels and just take it away when the grid power comes in.

Well, no, I mean, you're going to, well, that's true. Why would you have ever run that when you have grid power?

  

[@57:49](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3469.4) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Because the grid power, if we have, you wouldn't, you would have the grid power.

  

[@57:52](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3472.62) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah. Nevermind. Nevermind.

  

[@57:55](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3475.08) - **Erik Stockglausner**

The grid power will supplement the batteries when needed. Nevermind. You're right.

  

[@57:58](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3478.8) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

I don't know why I wasn't like, I I've been doing this so many times. Something, Yeah, okay. I think all natural gas generators is the way to go then.

I don't think turbines make sense. You mean all re-sips?

  

[@58:09](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3489.96) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yeah. So all diesel generators, but for day one, if we don't have grid power, the turbine is a good option, plus the re-sips to provide backup to the data center in an emergency.

Yeah.

  

[@58:29](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3509.14) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Okay. Let's have a separate meeting about this, like if we need diesel or not, because we still have best, right?

Like you'd have to, but you mean, that's another layer of the gas goes out and the gas goes out, then you're, you're .

You know what mean? Did you want to have that two N type capability where you have diesel as well?

  

[@58:51](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3531.94) - **Erik Stockglausner**

What you want is you want to back up to the turbine if something goes wrong with the single turbine, and that could be compensated by the reciprocating compressors.

Yeah. So you're, you're always going to feed power through. The best system. Does Recep imply diesel?

  

[@59:05](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3545.73) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah. Yeah, it's a Recep combustion engine. Yeah, but a natural gas generator, that's not necessarily a turbine, is it?

It's just a natural gas generator. Well, you have turbines and Recep.

  

[@59:19](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3559.07) - **Erik Stockglausner**

A turbine has no cylinders. It's just a turbine, like a jet engine.

  

[@59:23](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3563.51) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

But you could have a natural gas reciprocating generator. Yes. Which seems like a better move, right? Unless you don't have gas.

  

[@59:33](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3573.07) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yeah. Okay, perfect.

  

[@59:34](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3574.19) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

That's what I thought.

  

[@59:35](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3575.17) - **Erik Stockglausner**

So the onsite diesel is the insurance for the customer that if the turbine doesn't work, let's say the batteries start to deplete and the turbine goes to kick on and it doesn't.

Then the generators will have to kick on to provide power to the battery system so the data center doesn't go down.

And you can run those indefinitely as long as you can provide diesel fuel. So for our tier three or whatever.

  

[@1:00:01](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3601.92) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Do we need it? You need redundant reserve power, yes. But redundant grid, some battery, natural gas, and diesel. Discount the battery because the battery can't hold the whole load.

But you do have grid and the natural gas is your backup. That is natural gas not considered enough of a backup.

  

[@1:00:23](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3623.18) - **Erik Stockglausner**

So if you have natural gas turbines, that could be your primary power source for the BES system. If you lose grid power or, or whatever, you know, but then you can have reciprocating engines like Rolls-Royce engines that will be the backup.

They would be the diesel backup for the natural gas turbine if it doesn't work or if we lose natural gas.

But they're the backup to the backup is what I'm saying.

  

[@1:00:49](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3649.82) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

They're the backup.

  

[@1:00:50](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3650.88) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yeah. They're the backup to the backup.

  

[@1:00:52](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3652.72) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

And do we need a backup to the backup to hit whatever tier?

If you, if you, if you have, if you don't have, you always have to have N plus one. One on.

  

[@1:01:04](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3664.05) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

So in my mind, N plus one is like an extra generator if you lose a generator, not an extra type of generation capacity if I lose that whole generation capacity, meaning if I lose natural gas, so I have to have N plus one on the fuel type as well?

No.

  

[@1:01:24](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3684.49) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Right.

  

[@1:01:25](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3685.09) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

I'm just asking you for like, can we make a decision on do we need diesel or not? I think it's a wise decision.

  

[@1:01:30](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3690.71) - **Erik Stockglausner**

If you're going to have a single turbine, you have to have diesel. If you're going have two turbines, you probably don't need diesel.

  

[@1:01:37](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3697.43) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

I'm thinking that we just have all the same natural gas reciprocating generators because they're cheaper than turbines, right?

  

[@1:01:48](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3708.49) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Not to run. Not to run, but we have good power, so we're probably not going to be running them that much.

So no matter what your reserve power is, you have to have an extra level of reserve power. So you can have two turbines, or you can have a turbine and re-sips, but you have to have two sources of reserve power in case one of those goes down.

  

[@1:02:14](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3734.64) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

I'm assuming you're grid connected though.

  

[@1:02:17](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3737.46) - **Erik Stockglausner**

It doesn't matter. You have to have two, you have to have redundant reserve power. The grid doesn't count.

  

[@1:02:26](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3746.82) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Grid goes out, that main power gone, reserve power, two generators. Yep. They can be turbines, and they can be reciprocating, and they could be natural gas, or they could be diesel, right?

And I'm just saying that I think the cheapest model is probably a natural gas reciprocating generator. Is that not true?

The cheapest model, the most cost-effective model is a turbine?

  

[@1:02:49](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3769.44) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yeah, it's a non-standard. I don't even know if you could run generators at medium voltage. I don't know if they make a generator that will supply two and a half megawatts that's fed from natural gas, a re-sip.

Okay. Okay. So it's a turbine. You have to have, you either need to have one turbine and a set of reciprocating compressors or two turbines.

Now, I like the former option because if you lose natural gas, you still got the diesel. What are these here in this switch?

  

[@1:03:19](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3799.62) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

These are all diesel. Okay, so they're using diesel. And so I assume they have a big storage tank somewhere.

  

[@1:03:25](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3805.72) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yeah, they probably sit on a belly tank and they might have storage on site as well.

  

[@1:03:29](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3809.9) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

So normally you would pay the extra, but I guess it might not even be that extra, right? But like, if we have a natural gas, like we have good natural gas connectivity in that site, would you not use it?

I would use it if you're going to put a turbine in.

  

[@1:03:46](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3826.44) - **Erik Stockglausner**

I wouldn't expect to use it for reciprocating compressors. would use diesel.

  

[@1:03:51](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3831.02) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Right. The diesel's there just in the case of natural gas goes down or the turbine doesn't start.

  

[@1:03:56](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3836.4) - **Erik Stockglausner**

I totally understand.

  

[@1:03:58](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3838.84) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Is it worth the, is it worth the spend is all I'm trying to figure out. I think it's absolutely worth the spend because you're going to have a hard enough time getting customers except that they don't have diesel backup.

Okay, so you would recommend that we put in, like here, a line of diesel generators?

  

[@1:04:15](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3855.93) - **Erik Stockglausner**

For the first phase, I would say, have the temporary turbine online to provide power.

  

[@1:04:23](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3863.45) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

But that's only if they don't get grid power in time, correct? Correct.

  

[@1:04:27](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3867.79) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Let's assume they're not going to have grid power on the day they turn over the data center. That's what my assumption has been up to this point.

  

[@1:04:35](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3875.29) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Maybe. I don't know. Yeah, I would hope that they can get their stuff together. And within two years or whatever it takes us to build this whole thing that will have grid power.

But maybe the interconnect takes longer than two years.

  

[@1:04:45](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3885.69) - **Erik Stockglausner**

If they're going to have grid power day one, I would probably just standardize on diesel because you're not going to use it very often.

Perfect.

  

[@1:04:54](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3894.27) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

That's exactly what I was going for. It's really like we there's so many unknowns based on this study that's going on Camelot.

And like, what is It's the capacity of electricity that we can get from the grid, like that's, we don't know, you know what I mean?

  

[@1:05:06](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3906.34) - **Erik Stockglausner**

And so we're building a little bit blind, but, um, that's, that's, that's why these roll up turbines are effective because if you don't have grid power, you've got that extra layer of reserve generator capacity to support.

  

[@1:05:22](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3922.86) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Perfect. Okay. Totally clear.

  

[@1:05:25](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3925.1) - **Erik Stockglausner**

You can even get away without the turbine. If you wanted to go 100% reset, but if you don't have grid power, that's an expensive way to get your energy.

Electricity at night.

  

[@1:05:33](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3933.9) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah. I looked at the cost. That's crazy. It's like five X.

  

[@1:05:39](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3939.82) - **Erik Stockglausner**

So if there's no grid power, we want to have a turbine there to charge the batteries every night because it's going to be needed.

If we have grid power, we just want to build like a standard generator lineup, an NB generator lined up.

  

[@1:05:54](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3954.6) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

And for all intents and purposes, the design doesn't need to change because we'll have plenty of space. All right.

So.

  

[@1:06:02](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=3962.11) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Well, you know, Julia, does this clear things up a little bit? We're going to cut this building in half.

We're going to build the entire building, but we're only going to fit half of it out, plus the office and store and loading dock.

We're only going to provide half of the equipment that's necessary. We may not even need all of this because this is for 48 megawatts.

We're going to assume our first space is 12. So we're going to need a fourth of this. Do you remember the PUE on this situation?

It was low. It was very low. was like a 1.2 something because it's all direct-to-ship. Now, Vegas is going to be a little higher than it's going to be in Atlanta, but it's hotter.

  

[@1:06:42](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4002.47) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

So direct-to-ship would have, yeah, that makes sense because you have a lot. So you're going to have a higher PUE at a lower rack density.

So you're going to have a higher facility load. I'm just trying to make sure that... Yeah, okay. I can do that calculation.

Do you want to talk about how many racks? I'm always Start ... We're trying to fit in there? Well, let's have that conversation.

  

[@1:07:04](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4024.66) - **Erik Stockglausner**

But I think first, let's get Julie just to fill out the white space because I don't want to confuse her too much.

Now she knows what she needs to do in terms of the white space in the building, the racks. So there is a solution.

It's basically like sliding your computer cabinet into a refrigerator.

  

[@1:07:21](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4041.38) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah. And, and that solution is very elegant.

  

[@1:07:24](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4044.68) - **Erik Stockglausner**

It has a fan coil unit on top. It's, it's very similar to a rear door heat exchanger, except the heat from the server, instead of going right into a radiator on the back, it goes up right here on top.

And that solution is what they've employed here. And that gives you the ability to cool standard racks, and it's got a place for directorship.

So you can easily come back and put the direct-to-chip computer in there. And you just have to have the space to put in the chilled water.

  

[@1:07:57](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4077.7) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

And in this, in this design. Do they have anything like capacitors or anything like that? I guess they're using all that UPS switchgear.

I know we would have the best, but was he using the best on, like, big AI loads? Was it able to handle, like...

Yeah, that's how he built his data center in Memphis. So in other words, it's actually better than UPSs, because UPSs are going to get wrecked faster.

Yeah, the best system is going to be much better for AI workloads.

  

[@1:08:30](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4110.7) - **Erik Stockglausner**

It's got to be designed for it. Don't get me wrong, it needs to be designed for it, but yeah, they're much better.

You can look up the... I looked up some of the things.

  

[@1:08:43](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4123.18) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

I just didn't know about, like, the... Like, if you're thinking about, you know, like, gigabit of a big training model, it's wrecking the load back and forth.

It's like, is this the best handle that? I'm sure they have some other sort of thing in between their monster.

Training data center.

  

[@1:09:03](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4143.97) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yeah, so let's see here if I can put it in here. What was that data center call? I forget.

  

[@1:09:14](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4154.69) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

What was it called? It was called the It's Memphis. That's like the life or something. Oh, here you go.

Right.

  

[@1:09:26](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4166.79) - **Erik Stockglausner**

This is they actually had to retrofit this building, but if you look in. Here's this. He used raised floor, but basically all those tap boxes are up here for electric.

And these are all those compute clusters. It's all liquid chip and try and see if there's a better.

  

[@1:09:45](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4185.11) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

They probably use raised floor because they didn't have the space to make the roof higher because they already had the roof.

Yeah.

  

[@1:09:50](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4190.33) - **Erik Stockglausner**

You know, I'm hearing that some clients are going back to raised floor because they want to put everything underneath it.

And I'm like, I'd rather see the problem and know there's a problem. Here's an example. So if you see all these data centers, they're all long buildings with equipment yards on either side, right?

This is probably, yeah, this is Meta. Meta has a central office area and then they've got large data centers.

All the network and storage that needs to be air conditioned goes in the middle. And then these buildings out here are usually like free air cooling.

But what I wanted to see was, there you go. There's your turbines.

  

[@1:10:36](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4236.58) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Right there.

  

[@1:10:37](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4237.7) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Pretty sure that's what those are. So must use turbines.

  

[@1:10:40](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4240.92) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

While we're doing this, there's something fun that we wanted to share. We were thinking about externally having some sort of really simple grid type, like a chain link fence, not chain link fence, but just something simple that you could grow vines up.

You know what mean? On the outside of building. It's offset from the building a little bit. And then there's just like a.

here? go.

  

[@1:11:02](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4262.27) - **Erik Stockglausner**

the facade that you would just grow vines up to like have there be green awesome i love that um you say grown what what kind of plant a vine yes fine fine okay here is um uh this is probably not going to try see if there's a better image but here's the so and this is not a good one here this is for all one but it doesn't show it these are actually it doesn't show it right here this is a bad example but on the outside building yeah these are just some examples of pictures to show you this is kind of a green wall on the outside it's a separate structure but but you can do it a number of ways you

There's one way to do it. This is in Germany, so I don't know how practical this is. It'll grow in Oklahoma.

  

[@1:12:08](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4328.82) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

There's a number of vines that'll grow. There you go.

  

[@1:12:12](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4332.64) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yeah, for sure. I'll you the picture of it. So it's kind of hard to see, but right here, see this area here?

Yes. That's all green. These are all the generators. This is actually a bad picture. The roof looks a lot different than this because they've changed it up, but it's a lot more green on the exterior.

  

[@1:12:30](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4350.92) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

Got it. I love it.

  

[@1:12:32](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4352.22) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Than is shown here, but it's a, it's a, if you've ever seen they make this material where they punch it and they stand and they stretch it and it creates this open void between the spaces and the vines grow on that.

So yeah, it's almost like a, it's just a trellis or a gridded, you know, you could even just have some sort of a steel grid.

  

[@1:12:57](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4377.14) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah, it's exactly.

  

[@1:12:59](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4379.0) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yeah. Luminum grid that's, I can get you the spec.

  

[@1:13:10](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4390.5) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah, you can do it also with tensors, metal ones, but I think it's like, let's go the cheapest and best weatherproofing to the exterior and then build a little thing right outside of it for part of it, wherever they need to have some, good-looking data center.

  

[@1:13:35](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4415.44) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

But the idea is to have like a double skin. So leave the concrete wall clean and separate it a few inches.

Yeah, and then have like a double skin. Totally.

And just a good sheet gridded, like, you know, almost like even like rebar, you know, not rebar, but something of the sort.

Yeah.

  

[@1:13:59](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4439.4) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

Yeah. yeah. Thank you. Thank Yeah, here, I'll share my screen real quick.

  

[@1:14:42](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4482.31) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

I think not exactly, but you can kind of see, like, something like this. Yes, it makes sense.

  

[@1:14:49](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4489.13) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

Yeah, not that, that's not, yeah, more like that. Okay.

  

[@1:14:55](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4495.99) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah, but, like, kind of it, just better looking. Yeah.

  

[@1:15:02](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4502.4) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

Yeah, but it's a simple one just to have the plants grow there, that's it.

  

[@1:15:10](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4510.94) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah, I mean that's cool too, like some sort of, I guess that's just lighting, this is the same steel, it's probably galvanized steel mesh.

Yeah, in Alphenbach they're using aluminum.

  

[@1:15:28](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4528.24) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Are they?

Why? Just durability? Yeah, erosion resistance. Life cycle of it. Galvanized will probably last many years though, but yeah. Yeah, you get the point.

Yeah.

  

[@1:15:46](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4546.9) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

If I can find that detail.

  

[@1:15:48](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4548.42) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Alright, so let's wrap for that.

  

[@1:15:52](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4552.4) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

I think that you've got a lot of marching orders. It's probably best to write a list of like what...

And then I will also go through and like create some action items from this. Like I owe you best.

I probably owe you a few other things that I'm not remembering right now. Um, but like, let's like create a list of all the changes that need to be made.

And then any, any like clarifications that we need to dig into, like, you know, how many of this do I need or what square footage of this, that kind of stuff that way we can get it answered without you.

I mean, luckily you have that existing Oh, cool. You have that existing, um, layout, which is great. But if we, if we centered on what we said, 20 and 20, right, Erik?

Yep. White space.

  

[@1:16:42](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4602.97) - **Erik Stockglausner**

20 and 20 white space, and then fit the other things in there. Don't forget Julia on either side of the white space, you need that little protective corridor.

And that can also serve as like the CDU gallery or fan wall or whatever it becomes. But I'm just saying you want to make sure you have that perimeter around the white spaces.

saying as well. well. All

  

[@1:17:05](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4625.92) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

Erik, you were mentioning that you wanted significant space to, like, rack and stack and stuff.

  

[@1:17:12](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4632.04) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Was that in that model?

  

[@1:17:17](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4637.96) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Erik, you just leave a big open area at this point, right? So this is where the loading dock is right here.

  

[@1:17:26](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4646.04) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Wait, is that all under the roof, that whole thing? This is under roof.

  

[@1:17:31](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4651.46) - **Erik Stockglausner**

This is not. Okay. It should have some protective cover overs, probably. But that's, like, warehousing space.

  

[@1:17:38](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4658.42) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

That's open space. Okay, so that's a good amount of open space to be able to do a lot of work.

  

[@1:17:44](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4664.26) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yeah, because ultimately what they're going to do, this is going to be a big empty space, they're going to put a cage around it.

  

[@1:17:49](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4669.66) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Have you seen a cage in a data center?

  

[@1:17:51](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4671.7) - **Erik Stockglausner**

And then that cage is going to be, you know, quartered off or whatever. Or they could build rooms. It doesn't matter.

Right now, we don't care. We're going to leave it a big empty open space. Okay? Okay? We'll You'll need a restroom that the truck drivers can get to, you know, so you've got that on there already.

We've talked about showers for the staff, and we've talked about this concept of a mezzanine in the middle of the building, right?

Yeah.

  

[@1:18:19](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4699.38) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

want it raised, actually?

  

[@1:18:21](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4701.56) - **Erik Stockglausner**

I would like to see that raised up above. You know, you could have, the space below could be open.

  

[@1:18:27](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4707.38) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Is worth increasing the entire size of our roof to do that? I don't know if I understand what you mean.

Well, it's like the height. You're going to increase the height of the entire building. No, absolutely. I think it's absolutely worth it.

  

[@1:18:42](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4722.74) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Because you don't have to go that much up because this is going to be just a knock. So it doesn't, you don't need like, you don't need 30 feet to build a knock.

It can be empty. Yeah.

  

[@1:18:54](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4734.94) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Under the room, it can be empty.

  

[@1:18:56](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4736.66) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

It's just a few feet. Let's say, I don't Uh. Uh. Oh, okay. So you're six feet, eight feet, we're not going, we're not going to the second story.

  

[@1:19:09](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4749.93) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

We're just elevating it so that they can see, like when someone's standing, they can see over a rack easily.

So, and you could, you could have a little storage under it or something like that. So, yeah.

  

[@1:19:21](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4761.93) - **Erik Stockglausner**

So underneath here, you could have, this could be your knock area and some daycare underneath for all the kids below.

You could have the locker rooms, the laundry room, the showers, all that could be in the center section. Okay.

Okay. Or this is an area that's specifically for the operations team. Okay, perfect.

  

[@1:19:45](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4785.73) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

And they'll be the showers.

  

[@1:19:47](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4787.61) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

repeat that? Go ahead. What was your question?

  

[@1:19:52](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4792.37) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

If you can repeat it, which rooms, the knock, the showers, the restroom with the showers also?

  

[@1:20:00](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4800.05) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yeah.

  

[@1:20:00](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4800.49) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

think about the locker room, yeah. Think, think about

  

[@1:20:02](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4802.56) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Think what the guys who are there 24 seven, think of anything that they're going to need, right? The first level, this section here should just be walled off and carved up and you can have an elevator that goes up or stairs that go up, whatever.

But what you want this section to be here is that whole section right in the center of the building where it's relatively protected is going to be for the operations team.

Okay. And then anything that they're going to need, they're going to need access to bathrooms. They're going to, they want to be able to get quickly to the bathroom, to the locker room, to the laundry room, to the break room.

That will all be in this general area here, right in the center of the building, just for the operations guys.

So really nobody else will have access to that space, but the operations team. But it's still a single story, right?

So in your mind, let me, so the building height, you need at least 28 to 30 feet from slab to roof.

  

[@1:20:56](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4856.86) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Because to take care of this, all the infrastructure.

  

[@1:21:01](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4861.18) - **Erik Stockglausner**

So you're going to have. All the infrastructure is going to come up above, and you're going to need space above that to stack it.

You're going to need the traditional build for data center is 28 to 30 feet from deck to ceiling. It's 30 foot roof.

  

[@1:21:17](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4877.29) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Okay. So with 30 feet, we have enough space to do two things below and things above the office.

  

[@1:21:22](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4882.49) - **Erik Stockglausner**

And then the track or runway would kind of go all the way around. You'd have a section here. Well, so we will use that middle area then to create an air seal so that we can have the higher pressure for each side.

  

[@1:21:39](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4899.99) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Right. So this could be, this could be a corridor.

  

[@1:21:43](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4903.21) - **Erik Stockglausner**

It could be a little running track, which would be kind of cool. You know, that center section could have a little weight room in the bottom or a little gym.

There's enough room there to put a gym, a bathroom, locker rooms, laundry room, all that stuff. Got it. Yeah.

And then along the top, along the entire length of the building. you. Thank It could be, you know, a little running track that goes all the way around, and then you'll have windows that you can look in and look down on the data center.

Oh, an elevated running track.

  

[@1:22:13](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4933.94) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yes. And is there, there's no drop ceiling or anything. It's all open, right? And we had, but for the, the mid, like for, do we want to try to seal off half of it from the air?

You know what I mean?

  

[@1:22:32](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4952.78) - **Erik Stockglausner**

So the wall will go from floor to ceiling all the way around the data hall space. Right. But not, but the track is outside that space.

  

[@1:22:41](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4961.64) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

It's a different, different air. Yep.

  

[@1:22:43](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4963.74) - **Erik Stockglausner**

The track is outside that space with windows. You can look down into it.

  

[@1:22:49](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4969.04) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

You get that Julia? Yeah.

  

[@1:22:52](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4972.24) - **Erik Stockglausner**

So now. So we will have elevated, elevated corridors.

  

[@1:22:56](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4976.44) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

There is on top of the, it's part of the buffer zone, right? Yep. So. That we can access, it's okay if we access to those elevator corridors only from the NUC, because if not, we will have other stairs, and it will complicate security and space.

  

[@1:23:17](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=4997.2) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Right, so you will want there to be a place on either side where you can take an elevator up, you know, have elevator and stairs, so there might be elevator and stairwell right here.

Yeah.

  

[@1:23:32](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=5012.32) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Well, you would need, where's the entrance to the building? Down here. So you would actually want stairs at the entrance so that you can then get on the runway to walk to the NUC, right?

So technically, you can.

  

[@1:23:46](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=5026.54) - **Erik Stockglausner**

However, from a security standpoint, she makes a very good point. We don't want just anybody walking up and going out on that running track, even though it's separate from the infrastructure by a wall and windows.

You don't want just people wandering around up there. There. There.

  

[@1:24:02](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=5042.69) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

I thought the whole idea was that guests could enter your building without having to be walking on the data hall floor.

  

[@1:24:09](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=5049.77) - **Erik Stockglausner**

All guests that are going to tour the data center are going to be escorted by security and probably a member of operations.

  

[@1:24:16](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=5056.93) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

So they're going to go through the interior of the data hall into the knock room and then up. So they will go into the data hall, but they're not walking around on the servers.

They're going to get above it. Okay. They'll get above the data hall.

  

[@1:24:29](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=5069.07) - **Erik Stockglausner**

They'll be bifurcated from the data hall through a wall that they could look down and see the compute down below.

Right? So when you give a tour of somebody of a data center, you want them to see all the electrical mechanical equipment.

You want them to see the data hall space. You want them to see the knock. These are things that they're going to want to see to qualify it as a real data center.

I want to know you've got a knock. I want to know. Here's another thing. You know, there's got to be an entrance somewhere down below to get into that tornado shelter.

Yeah. I don't want them go outside the building to get to that. It is going to be in the basement.

  

[@1:25:02](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=5102.29) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

in the basement. Thank Right?

  

[@1:25:03](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=5103.32) - **Erik Stockglausner**

think it's best. Just a small little area. Yeah. You know, simple tornado, shelter, ventilator, whatever.

  

[@1:25:09](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=5109.6) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

many people are we talking? How many operators?

  

[@1:25:14](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=5114.56) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

I would say 12 to 15 people. Yeah, 12 to 15.

  

[@1:25:20](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=5120.24) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Well, just to 15. Yeah, they're just there to let the tornado pass. So, you know, you need ventilation. You know, it's not a bomb shelter.

They're not going to sit there indefinitely. You need ventilation. You need some, you know, some benches for them to sit on.

It's just there to protect them while the tornado goes overhead. Yeah. Got it. And that would be great if it was near the bathrooms or, you know, I'm just, but ideally it just goes underground and it, you know, might even take them outside the building envelope and it might end up out here, but it's all, it's going to be underground.

So, so it's going to be protected from. The alternative to that is just to have a big strong box inside the building that serves as a tornado shelter, right?

So the locker rooms, the shower, the locker room, the locker room could be the tornado.

  

[@1:26:24](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=5184.59) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Just build, build a big thick wall and then everybody just goes into the locker room. Exactly.

  

[@1:26:29](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=5189.27) - **Erik Stockglausner**

That's that's an alternative. That was another option too. I think that's just cheaper, easier.

  

[@1:26:35](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=5195.99) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

You can buy these. We did it at Digital.

  

[@1:26:38](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=5198.27) - **Erik Stockglausner**

bought a big giant metal building. Yeah. And it was outside, but it was a place they could feel if a tornado was coming.

So they had to walk out, which I thought was kind of stupid, but they had to walk outside.

  

[@1:26:48](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=5208.81) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

required to have a tornado shelter in this zone? No. No. Okay.

  

[@1:26:53](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=5213.93) - **Erik Stockglausner**

But it's a feature that I think people will appreciate because your operations team, you know.

  

[@1:27:00](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=5220.77) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

I went to school and. Yeah. No Thank In Oklahoma, I know. I've seen tornadoes, more than one.

  

[@1:27:08](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=5228.04) - **Erik Stockglausner**

The equipment yard is going to be surrounded by, you know, some sort of a structural, acoustic concrete wall. Laser shooting drones.

You know, the entire perimeter will be surrounded by a fence, like we talked about. But yeah, if you can build this to go 12 to 24 megawatts, I think you've got a really solid product here for the market, with Google, especially if you get GCP, Google Cloud Platform, on-ramp.

Okay.

  

[@1:27:46](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=5266.58) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

We need to run this by, I'm going to call David after. The other thing too, just so you know, it's like all this equipment out here is super heavy.

  

[@1:27:55](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=5275.34) - **Erik Stockglausner**

The chances of a tornado ripping this off the ground are slim to none. That also provides an added layer of protection for the building.

Combine that with a roof that's rated at FM 1-150, and you've got a pretty strong, like, you have to have a hell of a tornado come through there.

Perfect. Awesome. And we'll get into that. Go ahead.

  

[@1:28:22](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=5302.96) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

For those equipments, for the electrical rooms and generator, do we have a concrete path?

  

[@1:28:31](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=5311.58) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yep. Yeah, right.

  

[@1:28:34](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=5314.78) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

Okay.

  

[@1:28:35](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=5315.62) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

So the exteriors, are they going to pour pads out there, or is it just going to be, what's the...

Yep. But it's not going to be foundational, it's just going to be like a parking lot, right?

  

[@1:28:45](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=5325.96) - **Erik Stockglausner**

It's going to have to be structural enough to support the load of a generator and the fuel that goes in the belly tank.

  

[@1:28:53](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=5333.9) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

And then the coolers, are they also on concrete? They sit on isolation dampeners, because they vibrate?

  

[@1:29:01](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=5341.28) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yeah, know you're paving this whole thing.

  

[@1:29:02](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=5342.85) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Right? Like everything on the screen right now is paved basically. All concrete. That's too bad.

  

[@1:29:13](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=5353.27) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Now, to be fair, you could create concrete areas for the equipment, but you're gonna have to have concrete areas for the transformers, the generators, the electrical rooms, and the chillers.

Everything else could be gravel. So if you want to minimize your concrete use, you could do that. They make a material I actually think is a really good idea for like parking.

It's a web type material that you put on the ground and grass can grow up through it. You can put gravel in it and grass grow up through it.

You can park on it and it doesn't move. doesn't wash away. It's great.

  

[@1:29:51](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=5391.03) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah, love that. It's super strong too. Although grass doesn't really do much either. Sorry, grass and concrete aren't. The water can then go into the ground, which is nice.

You don't end up with storm water. We're at the

  

[@1:30:04](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=5404.36) - **Erik Stockglausner**

But what you want to think about, you have to make sure trucks can get in and out. Heavy equipment can be supported.

Yeah. Cranes are going to drop all this stuff in place and you're going to have heavy trucks coming in for fueling and stuff like that for the generators.

Ideally, each of these generators will have its own belly tank, but they'll all be connected via a distribution manifold that will allow us to fill it from either the left or the right side.

You might not even have to enter the equipment yard to provide fuel to the generators, which would be nice.

  

[@1:30:37](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=5437.34) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

We need to do a second round of design.

  

[@1:30:40](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=5440.72) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

I feel like we've overwhelmed my brain.

  

[@1:30:43](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=5443.8) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Let's just get the building layout done and make sure you have enough room on either side of the building for the equipment.

And that's what we need to really do. Let's do that.

The building can fit on that space.

I think, I think I'm going to, should I call David and just confirm with him? Just tell him, well, do you want to like, or do you want to like display the whole idea and like sell them on that instead?

  

[@1:31:32](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=5492.23) - **Erik Stockglausner**

What I would, what I would say is let's let Julia see if she can fit it in the space that we have, because we go to say it's 12 megawatts and going to 24.

And then we go, oops, well, we changed your mind. It's going to be eight and 16. Yeah. Agreed.

All right. Yeah, we got to fit it. Let me draw it. Let me draw it.

  

[@1:31:51](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=5511.19) - **Julia Cacciavillani**

Start out with like total block size or fitting it in the space. You know what mean? Yeah. Yeah. So fit it, fit it into the, the.

  

[@1:32:02](https://fathom.video/share/-NrxRN5fNhQdHDzy7rfQS_3aNozN3FBZ?timestamp=5522.94) - **Erik Stockglausner**

place and then we can worry about what it looks like inside the big box yeah technically the building's gonna be about half the size of this one maybe a little more than half and it's gonna be split in two sections because this is 48 megawatts we're gonna be 24.

okay max 24 12 and 12. 12 okay perfect okay yeah now we've got all the equipment specs we've got everything we need basically to do this okay awesome bye bye guys great work Benton thanks thanks
