[@0:00](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=0.0) - **David Nocella**

How's it going? Good.

  

[@0:03](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=3.2) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

It's been full on on this one. I've got a lot for you. That's good.

  

[@0:10](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=10.5) - **David Nocella**

If we need to run long, I think that's fine.

  

[@0:14](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=14.64) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah, we might run long or we might just want to do a couple of meetings. There's so many topics, you know what I mean?

There's so many if this then that decisions that, you know, when we sized up, there was just lots of different possibilities.

And so we've got kind of a path forward for you, but there's a lot of little branches that you could take.

Like, do I want diesel generators or do I want natural gas generators? You know, natural gas generators now have hot start natural gas generators that can start in two minutes versus the, you know, old 10 minute one.

And then like the diesels are only 30 seconds. So you need this much battery in the UPS and blah, blah, blah, blah.

You know, you get like you get the, there's so many design choices. And like, I feel like we've done so much.

I just need. I start having these conversations with you.

  

[@1:02](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=62.532) - **David Nocella**

Yeah, I see how these compound, right? Mm-hmm.

  

[@1:07](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=67.932) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

So our heads are full of this. Erik made a bunch of changes last night, and I was like, whoa, hold on, man.

But the good thing is that him and Muhammed are coming from a place of having done this. And he's like, hey, when we did this in Amazon last year, we ran into this major problem of where this was.

And so we shifted the orientation of our building a little bit. so it'll be really fun to walk you through this.

I think you're going to like it.

  

[@1:37](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=97.692) - **David Nocella**

Yeah, no, let's do it. Let's try to get as many answers to you guys as possible today. And so we can start wrapping things up.

Walker should be joining. I expect Aaron should be on. But Walker just joined.

  

[@1:53](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=113.032) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Hey, Walker.

  

[@1:56](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=116.432) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Miller's got somebody's got a ladder up in the backyard. Hope that's not you. It might be.

  

[@2:05](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=125.724) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Where are you, Walker?

  

[@2:09](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=129.004) - **Walker Willis**

Well, I'm currently in Oregon, actually, in Southern Oregon. So, yeah, visiting family out here.

  

[@2:15](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=135.224) - **Erik Stockglausner**

I love Oregon. Yeah, it's nice. It's a little wetter than Colorado. Yeah. Just a little. How about you, David?

Are you in Colorado or are you in? Yeah, I'm in Fort Collins working from home.

  

[@2:29](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=149.904) - **David Nocella**

today. good for you. Most of the team's off this week. So, yeah. Well, I expect there's probably a lot to get through.

Aaron. jump in. Yeah. Probably we'll be joining here in a little bit. But if you just want to go through it, Bolt, Sal, we can try to get you answers.

Yeah.

  

[@2:50](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=170.824) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Let's start with the fun part. How about we start with the picture? What you think, Erik? Yeah.

  

[@2:54](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=174.944) - **Erik Stockglausner**

I mean, I think just showing them kind of that way we can, I think a picture of the house and works.

next Bye.

  

[@3:00](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=180.636) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Exactly.

  

[@3:02](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=182.816) - **David Nocella**

All right. Looks a little different than the RD-109.

  

[@3:08](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=188.736) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

But we've been working on a lot of projects lately. You know, there's a company called Switch who does some of the best builds out there.

And, you know, we've been working across some of the things like that. And so, you know, one of the things that we noticed is that we have space down there, right?

And, you know, Muhammad, he works often in Germany, where they're really space constrained. And so you're forced to kind of put everything in a small footprint.

But in here, we can have a yard on each side that allows us to kind of keep that core space in the building, which is the most expensive space contained in the building, your data rooms contained in the building, and then you have your yard down here, which has your generation, and then you're up here, which has your chilling.

So your mechanical and your electrical, basically on either side of the building. So what this does, right, I was gonna say, why don't we pause for a second and see if Walker

  

[@4:00](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=240.128) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Or anyone has any questions? No, no.

  

[@4:03](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=243.568) - **David Nocella**

Keep going. Okay. Okay. Sorry. Thank you. I just wanted to make sure we had first impressions.

  

[@4:07](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=247.508) - **Erik Stockglausner**

That looks great. Cool. Yeah.

  

[@4:09](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=249.568) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

So what this does is it lets you create these little containerized, like kind of pre-built utility or electrical sheds.

I guess they're probably called something else like following them electrical sheds. But and then your generators go down here and then you can just lay out everything really nicely in the yard and you have really short cable runs.

And it just becomes an easier design. And then up here, your chillers kind of follow the same methodology. In this specific building, the big building, obviously, you got the data hall in the middle.

And we have the kind of the knock and all of the goodies in the middle here. So that way, when you build out, you build this entire shell and you build some degree of these, but this entire shell gets built.

But this stays pretty much white space. that the You know what mean? So for future development, and then here is where you kind of cut it in half, condition this space fully, and then fit out this with all the details that you would want.

So there's a break here. This is just an example layout of racks.

  

[@5:16](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=316.52) - **Erik Stockglausner**

You could do it so many different ways.

  

[@5:19](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=319.04) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

But the reason that we chose kind of this type of white space is that we were thinking that these racks would be either, there's like a DDC rack which pulls heat up top, and there's something called a rear door heat exchanger which pulls heat to the side, puts it through fluid to the chillers, and that's where the predominant utility on the IT load heat goes to.

The split here is that eventually we'll design some columns in here. We haven't fully figured out the columns yet.

But we need to get some insurance information back on kind of like roof and, you know, building and all that, just to make sure that there's the right trade-off there between cost.

So you might have some columns down the middle of your data hall, but overall, you're going to have a really high performing data hall and pretty much it's, you know, it's very, it's a minimal there.

Yeah. Yeah. So going on, there's a lot of other things kind of packed in here. If you go down here.

Real quick.

  

[@6:25](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=385.932) - **David Nocella**

You mentioned the roof and the insurance costs. Is that, is that the email thread that we have going on with Lauren?

Is that, is that what you're waiting for? I'm not sure how fruitful that'll be, just FYI. Like, I think she responded that she'll try to provide something, but it's kind of outside of their scope.

Yeah. I saw that too. If you have another avenue to find out that information, I'd probably recommend that as well.

To run with that. That makes sense. In tandem. One question here. So I see, I see we have the, the rack build out on the left-hand side.

Mm-hmm.

  

[@6:59](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=419.612) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

go. You

  

[@7:00](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=420.224) - **David Nocella**

Now, with the white space on the right-hand side, if we fully built that out, would that be 100% occupancy at our, what is it, 10.5-megawatt IT load?

  

[@7:13](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=433.744) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah, so what we were thinking is that it makes the most sense to do blocks of three with a total 12 megawatts.

It just lines up really well with chillers, like chillers are 1.5 typically, you can get a bigger 2.5 chiller.

But when you start to like look at generator specs and chillers and all that, 12 just becomes like this much rounder, easier number to hit.

Just trying to get a sense of like, am I looking at 12 on the left here, or is it 12 altogether?

  

[@7:45](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=465.504) - **Erik Stockglausner**

You're looking at 12 on the left. Yeah, you're looking at 12 on the left.

  

[@7:49](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=469.024) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

You could be looking at 6 on the left. Do you know what I mean? It's like on the density, correct, correct.

So at the lower density… The whole thing is a 12 megawatt IT load at the higher density. You go up to about 24 ish megawatt IT load, but that then starts to rely on liquid cooling and other things like that to get that much density into, into the space.

And we have those, we have that capability kind of designed into this with the liquid cooling.

  

[@8:21](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=501.556) - **David Nocella**

Right. That's the goal.

  

[@8:22](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=502.716) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

So like, it won't be built out over here, but like, we'll have the, the, the necessary things for it to go in.

When you get a client that wants to do it.

  

[@8:30](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=510.836) - **Erik Stockglausner**

So from an, from an infrastructure standpoint, we have two separate loops for the air cooling. the fan coal units that sit on top of the cabinets required chilled water.

We have two separate loops for that to provide redundancy. If you have a client that says, Hey, we want to go direct chip cooling.

That's when we bring in the critical infrastructure plant, which is the same type of product, right? The standardized, the product, um, to add that density.

So we literally go from three to 12 megawatts. That's inside that data hall on the left, right? But you don't have to add all that capacity day one, you just have to prepare for it.

Sure, sure.

  

[@9:09](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=549.748) - **David Nocella**

Yeah, that provides great flexibility. I like it, guys.

  

[@9:15](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=555.648) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Awesome.

  

[@9:17](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=557.008) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

And then, if you kind of look here, we spent some time designing all of the various spaces that the people would be in.

And Eric did a fantastic job. I don't know if you want to talk him through, Eric, or you want me to, but kind of like, talk him through what a tour would look like.

Yeah. So if you don't mind, pull up, pull up the, I think the other rendering.

  

[@9:36](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=576.388) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yeah. Okay. There you go. So this is kind of what I call a mezzanine level. And when you have visitors that want to come tour the data center, you're probably going to fit out a portion of it.

You know, maybe that first three megawatts, maybe a little more, maybe a little less. You want to be able to show customers that you've got an active functional data center.

So what we did was that center spine has all the technical operations people, so they can get to either side of.

We put in what could be a fitness room if you wanted to, but on that third level, there's also a dedicated and secure tour route.

So if you want to, we want to bring visitors in the data center, but you don't want to give them access to all of those critical spaces because that's a risk, right?

And electrical equipment, all that stuff, you don't really want people, you know, close to that, you know, arc flash concerns and things like that.

So this gives you an opportunity to walk them along an enclosed tour path with windows on either side so they can see mechanical gallery, they can see the data hall, and then balconies out on the equipment yard area so they can walk out and you show them the equipment yards without walking them into the equipment yard.

That's great. That make sense?

  

[@10:45](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=645.0) - **David Nocella**

Yep.

  

[@10:46](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=646.48) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

So that takes care of your folks, gives them plenty of space for the knock room. They sit on the second floor, so they can look out either side on the entire data hall, so they can kind of like see what's going on in the data hall troubleshoot from up.

And it just gives them a lot of flexibility. Plus, I think that, you know, with Eric and Muhammad having worked in data centers as much like they wish they had a lot of this stuff.

And when you think about the total cost of building a few rooms for people, it's really low compared to, you know, the costs of a lot of the things going into these facilities.

It's very, very minor. That tour route, one more thing.

  

[@11:28](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=688.072) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Whenever we design something, try to design it with multipurpose. It's also a route for security to do rounds or check out people to rounds just to give them a little more, you know, visibility into what's going on in the data center.

Yeah.

  

[@11:39](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=699.272) - **David Nocella**

Or even if you want to take a walk. Yeah. Yeah. No, it sounds like you guys have, you know, incorporated a lot of really practical, you know, and efficient ways of laying this building out.

Yeah.

  

[@11:51](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=711.832) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

And the good thing is you can also close half of it off, right? So that you can just condition this side and leave, you know, this one less conditioned or whatever.

like there? And you can you know, you know, I'm just to if that's And then the last little cool thing is that we did put in like a safe room here, which there was like a, you know, it was one, one speck we pulled from an Oklahoma company, but the idea of having like a tornado shelter or something like that, like that, that is a place they can just literally walk in there and they're totally safe.

Not to mention the building's kind of bulletproof, so it's a, it's a safe space. Yeah. So the flow and here, me, let me switch my screen a little bit and switch to different one.

Now, those are great for like a, like a bird's eye view.

  

[@12:40](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=760.084) - **David Nocella**

Perfect. Yeah. was curious, are there any other kind of like elevation views or other things that you're packaging together with it?

Yeah, we'll give you a full set of views.

  

[@12:49](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=769.324) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

We've been poor architect, poor girl. She's been trying to keep up with us. We've been changing so many things, but by, by the time we do the, the, the version for the investors, we'll have full 3d.

I have some preliminary ones I'll show you in just a sec, but yeah, we'll get the pretty ones. She's built it from Revit, right, Benton?

  

[@13:11](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=791.276) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yeah, it's all built in Revit.

  

[@13:12](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=792.936) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

So when you guys hire that next round of architects, they can literally take all this and they are in good shape.

They should give you a discount at least. But yeah, so we fit it on the site. We're working on the access right now.

So like up here, there's going to be, I mean, this is going to be gated area. This isn't the latest one, actually.

She was working on it for this meeting, so I don't have the latest latest, but I'll get that to you, you know, pretty soon.

I think we should have a couple of meetings between now and next week when we want to try to cap this off to finish everything.

But, you you'll have security access up here with kind of like a potential trap for cars. You'll have full access around the building and then access to the yards for various things to be able to refuel.

Or service or get a little, you know, crane truck in there to move heavy batteries or whatever it is.

So that we're working on, but for the most part, it fits right here. If you see what we did here, we did expand this road up a little bit.

And so we wanted to take a little bit of your solar away just to kind of make some more space.

And also we wanted to get a little bit, maybe with the substation, we can kind of size that out.

Maybe if you guys know what the substation size actually might be, we could essentially claim a little bit of this land too, just to kind of match the design.

But either one, you know, the yard's got plenty of space, but we could definitely use a couple extra feet there and maybe cut off 0.2 kilowatts.

  

[@14:47](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=887.048) - **David Nocella**

Walker will probably jump in here. I'm sure that's not a problem to remove a little bit of the array right there.

And he can confirm the acreage that we'll need for the substation, the battery storage area. So I assume that's...

The battery's right next to the substation on the right-hand side.

  

[@15:03](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=903.48) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah, and we can configure them however you want, and we just guessed 12, but, you know, 12 container sizes, but there might be more or less, but probably not much more.

  

[@15:15](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=915.16) - **Walker Willis**

Yeah, I mean, I would say, if anything, we would want to shift it all down and kind of carve into the substation space, because we're not going to need a ton of space for the substation.

I mean, that's like, you know, three-quarters of an acre will be sufficient. Yeah. The battery's maybe a couple acres, and so I would prefer that versus going up and cutting into the rows, because like, you know, you, it feels like it's just a couple, you know, panels.

But really, because of how the rows are, if you cut in two panels, you end up taking a third of the entire row.

Because you have to go down to, they just have like a one, a two, and a three, basically, length-wise.

And so, as soon as you You a couple of panels, you go from three to a two, yeah, exactly.

And it's like number of strings per row is the one, two, three. And so one string has, I think it's like nine or something panels.

And so it takes like a decent little chunk. So I'd prefer to shift it down a little bit and then we can kind of massage the substation and battery to fit around your guys's design.

  

[@16:26](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=986.932) - **Erik Stockglausner**

How much, how much, how much control do we have over that pink area? Is that pink area off limits completely?

That is off limits.

  

[@16:35](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=995.452) - **Walker Willis**

That's the, that continues to be the, the easement to the transmission company that we can't, you know, we can't cancel.

  

[@16:44](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=1004.37) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Can you build road on it?

  

[@16:47](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=1007.97) - **Walker Willis**

Um, I would say we probably could, um, we can build the road under there and get away with that.

Yeah. Well, there's no, no, no current power lines going down that easement.

  

[@17:00](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=1020.17) - **Erik Stockglausner**

It's just. Oh, right, exactly. Okay. So the way the building is currently laid out, we can make some adjustments to it, but the way the current building is laid out, there's not a whole lot of room we have to move down, only because the way we currently have the loading dock limits our ability to squish it.

So we could, you know, rotate the loading dock a little bit differently and design a little bit differently so we can squeeze that real estate that we need in a little bit.

So we just have to look into how we would go about that. In other words, instead of the trucks facing, you know, east-west in this example, they'd be facing north-south and maybe along that south side of the building where the electrical yard is located or vice versa on the other side.

  

[@17:45](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=1065.88) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

if we could, if we could design, if we could just get the substation to a little bit more fidelity, then I think we can work with it.

Cause maybe we can just cut this corner off or maybe like, I don't know what, but getting that a little higher fidelity with some room for mistakes, you know, some.

I would say our biggest constraint right now is the width of the electrical equipment yard. So we can't really go any smaller, any narrower than that unless we cut capacity.

Um, we can, if we move it down, we can take up some little bit more space up top for the mechanical yard.

Um, and like I said, we might be able to shift the loading dock to where the trucks basically unload north, south, instead of east, west.

So we don't have to have as much clearance there on the left side of the building. Okay. So there's some, there's there's some things there that, that, that we can certainly do to kind of make it a little narrower, but if, as we move it down, we're going to run into problems with setbacks.

We're going to have to have, you know, ability to have where people are going to park. How do we accommodate parking?

So we can do that. Um, the other thing is, you know, we've got all the roof real estate you want, aside from maybe some air handling units.

I don't know if that is even the value in this scenario to have the, to replace what solar we steal from the ground to put it on the roof, you know, but, head

That's up to you. Yeah, yeah.

Mark, are we- was thinking that anyways, do we want to do Rift Solar and I thought last night? Yeah, man, I thought that's a down the road item.

  

[@19:11](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=1151.37) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yeah, fair enough.

  

[@19:12](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=1152.01) - **Walker Willis**

It's hard to mesh the energy modeling of the two different types with the trackers and the rooftop. Yeah, totally.

Sorry, David, you were going to say something?

  

[@19:22](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=1162.91) - **David Nocella**

I was just going to ask, well, you were probably going to put together a general arrangement for the substation, right?

Yeah, yeah, and I can accelerate that.

  

[@19:31](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=1171.79) - **Walker Willis**

was going to be kind of a last towards the end of the process, but I can get something put together sooner rather than later if that helps kind of define what space is available for you guys to work with.

  

[@19:44](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=1184.73) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Walker, do you know if that substation will be designed or have the flexibility to accept grid power? It will, right?

Yeah, yeah, definitely. I mean, that's 100% the plan. Okay. So in our The basis of design, basically put in, when the grid comes, we'd like to take power to 130,000 volts if we can, or as high voltage as possible.

Right. We want to transform everything to a common bus, like 11 KV, so 11,000 volts. That voltage works really nice in terms of supply chain for equipment.

We can do MV across the board for generators. We can leg off of that into LV systems. It makes the wire sizing smaller.

makes everything line up very nicely. And the products, quite frankly, are just more readily available. mean, go try to get a two megawatt or two and a half megawatt low voltage gen these days, and you're looking at two years sometimes.

Right.

  

[@20:41](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=1241.5) - **Walker Willis**

That's an interesting piece that we're going to have to mesh, David, on our side, is because the most common equipment from the renewable energy side is 34.5 KV, Erik.

And you're saying that you data centers are typically running at like 11 KV?

  

[@20:57](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=1257.9) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Not necessarily what I'm saying. Is that if you don't have any intention on tying the renewable to the grid, then you can still use step-up transformers to get it to that voltage.

What we think worked out best was to be able to pull, to drop everything into an 11,000 volt bus.

We'll do that. The generators will have, you know, that allows us to gradually incrementally grow and allows us to optimize wire sizing and supply chain.

It doesn't mean you can't go in that and, and up, you know, transform up to a different power if you need to, but the generators and stuff that, that we see having higher availability tend to be there.

I interrupt? Yeah, please. He's, Muhammad's the expert.

  

[@21:43](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=1303.77) - **Muhammed Kurt**

11 KV might be standard across, uh, like Europe. Um, but I think in US it's a 13.8 KV.

  

[@21:55](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=1315.17) - **Erik Stockglausner**

It's, I think it's 13, four, seven, but I've done a little bit of research. I'll, I'll validate it. The research.

Yeah. And 60 hertz, 11 kV is not an off standard size.

  

[@22:08](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=1328.92) - **Walker Willis**

And you know, it doesn't necessarily make or break anything on my end. It's just that typically the generation from solar battery is stepped up from our like 600 volt to like a 34.5 kV.

You can step from 600 or 660 or whatever up to like a 12.47, but that's, I mean, we can make it work.

  

[@22:35](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=1355.1) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yeah, that's good to know that like... What was your preference though, Walker? I'm gonna write that down so I can check that.

13.47?

  

[@22:41](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=1361.06) - **Walker Willis**

Well, 34.5 is the most common medium voltage in renewable energy generation across the board in the US. The next is like 12.47.

And do you know, people get confused. Sometimes, right, of like line-to-line voltage versus line-to-ground voltage are slightly different values at times, but those are like the nominal voltages that should, yeah, that's what I'm most typically seeing is either the 34.5 or the 12.47.

  

[@23:19](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=1399.66) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Okay, we'll look at both of those.

  

[@23:21](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=1401.54) - **Walker Willis**

Okay, perfect.

  

[@23:23](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=1403.7) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah, so we've been kind of confirming with Muhammed and Erik and going back and forth on a couple things there.

But before we dig in too deep onto details, let me just showcase the design format a little bit. Yeah, real quick, Ben.

  

[@23:37](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=1417.72) - **David Nocella**

Maybe put a bow on the layout. Walker, if we can maybe get the general arrangement for the best in the substation, they could probably incorporate that line work into their site plan, right?

So that'll be in CAD for our CAD file for us, right? Yeah, for sure. Yeah. sure. Yep. Yeah. Maybe that'll help you, once you have that line work, maybe that'll help you know where you can expand south, you know, with that building footprint like you were asking.

Cool. I like it. Okay. Yeah, not forget the retention.

  

[@24:15](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=1455.97) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Right. Pond, yeah.

  

[@24:17](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=1457.17) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Pond's got to go down there, too. Right.

  

[@24:19](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=1459.63) - **David Nocella**

Okay. Now, feel free to take it away on the basis of design. Leave that.

  

[@24:27](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=1467.59) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Okay. Did I show you guys, you guys saw these other little ones? These right? Like some of the early 3D versions.

Yeah. Okay. So I think it'll probably be a little bit more like this, but she'll kind of add a little bit of extra to it.

Like, you know, we were thinking about doing stuff like kind of, you could grow some vines on certain walls and like grow, you know, have a little bit of green component to it, which would give it a nice look and just, just give it a little bit of pizzazz for the investor deck.

So that's the last step, though. Nice. All right. right. Thank you. So basis of design. So we use what's called the CSI master format.

Have you guys ever seen that? Yeah, I'm familiar.

  

[@25:08](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=1508.3) - **David Nocella**

Okay, perfect.

  

[@25:09](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=1509.24) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

So I'm going to skip to this part real quick and just kind of go down to the bottom. But each division is represented in this basis of design.

Obviously, it's much more detailed than is necessary. So a lot of it kind of all occurs in smaller docs and there's just like sort of some placeholders there.

  

[@25:25](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=1525.32) - **David Nocella**

But we wanted to make big as our consultant that helped us with the financial modeling use CSI master format to break out his bid estimate.

So these should be able to match really well together. That's great. Yeah. Yeah.

  

[@25:43](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=1543.6) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

So, yeah, I think that should, you know, I looked at your and your CapEx. We can talk about that in a little bit and just kind of how they they modeled it.

And we haven't gotten to the finance part yet that will occur next week. But preliminarily, we were right in line when we talked about per kilowatt.

So today, what I wanted to show is just a couple of them because there's a bunch of docs, but this is the exact summary, obviously the most important, but I also have a couple examples of like electrical, fire suppression, HVAC, so the other divisions are in there too.

But I think going through this makes a lot of sense and kind of like what we're thinking about so we can kind of get into some of the meat of some of the things.

So then we covered the facility fairly well with the 20,000 square foot data hall, but split in two. The cabinets, you know, obviously these are going to be based on the client, but you know, we're, we're optimizing for a rear door heat exchange or what's DDC cabinets, which is pull it up from the top.

Availability tier three, obviously. So everything there is pretty covered it. We will. I mean, I might just highlight this so that Eric, go through and we can go do.

A little bit of research.

  

[@27:03](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=1623.4) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Oh, that's the text right there. Perfect. Yeah.

  

[@27:10](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=1630.38) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Generators. So here's another area where we can have a whole discussion, but we've been back and forth between natural gas generators and diesel generators.

In this round, we're kind of landing on diesel generators for a couple purposes, and there's other documentation on this.

But the diesel generators kick in faster. They are cheaper to purchase initially, but more expensive to run. So one of the big things is, do we have grid power day one?

If we don't have grid power day one, then diesel doesn't really make sense. If we do have it day one, then it is probably the less expensive option.

But there's also additional regulation and demand response and things like that that could be modeled in, which might actually make the natural gas turbine generators either net neutral or maybe.

Even a little bit better. Initial calculations that we ran showed that it was going to be really tight or tough to do that.

And overall, as a generation strategy, some clients may prefer having diesel anyways, because in like a really cold, like polar vortex type event, sometimes natural gas goes out because freezing problems like we had in snowpocalypse and stuff.

So I don't know how prevalent that is. And I also don't know like if we've confirmed that natural gas line.

So those are probably there's a handful of things. I have those documented as like a, you know, decision tree.

But as far as generation goes, like, I think we're staying we're starting with with diesel, but it would be cool if we could make natural gas work just from the eco perspective and all the other things.

Yeah.

  

[@28:46](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=1726.72) - **David Nocella**

So it sounds like the the question to answer to determine this is timing on grid power. Walker, what do you think?

Walker, what do you think our timing on grid power would be? Would it be day one or are we going to try to.

Do this behind-the-meter thing for a year or two with the solar, with the ramp-up of occupancy. Just give me a second, David.

  

[@29:08](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=1748.63) - **Walker Willis**

I'm going to shake my eight ball here and see. Crystal, it's hard to say, David. mean, with what I'm learning about the whole chill and hill and the general want of large load interconnection, it's feeling more like we'll have grid power.

The reality of getting even that tap onto the 138kb or the 161kb is going to be, I think, the long pole of the tent.

It's not going to be the interconnection process necessarily. It's going to be, can I get a breaker fast enough?

Can I get a transformer fast enough to meet up with the construction of the project? So, yeah, I would say we need to lean, especially now that we're at, like, just to make things work.

We're at 12... 12 megawatts of load to make things neat, and our generation is barely 12 megawatts with the solar, you know, I think we really have to lean into the grid interconnection at this point, like, because we're going to be down to, I don't know, 12, 15%, you know, capacity factor with like the IT load plus the Jenner cooling and everything else.

So, you know, it feels like, David, that's great as the option, and now it's just like, how fast can we get those critical pieces of equipment, because I think the interconnection utility is going to accommodate, it's just the timing of the major equipment.

  

[@30:46](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=1846.72) - **David Nocella**

Sure, long-leaf procurement would definitely be a thing, but okay, so grid power day one, guys, does that make you lean towards natural gas generators?

Diesel.

  

[@30:58](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=1858.32) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Or diesel. Yeah.

  

[@31:00](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=1860.1) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yeah. There's a lot more work that needs to be done to determine if you want to participate in demand response, you have to utilize natural gas in some way, shape, or form.

So there is an argument and potentially an economic one to put in some microturbines so that you have the ability to participate in demand response.

But we have to do the investment or the cost benefit ratio analysis to determine what that is. And that's hard to do until you talk to your greater electricity provider to say, hey, what does demand response look like?

We've got publicly available data that shows that it does have some value, meaning if you can island away from the grid and take some portion of the power off the grid, you can get paid to do that in a fairly substantial amount.

But depending on your load characteristics and whatever you negotiate is going to determine how well that pencils out. Yeah.

  

[@31:54](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=1914.43) - **David Nocella**

Well, I think our batteries also provide demand response for the utility. Thank you, Walker, what were your thoughts on this?

you.

  

[@32:03](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=1923.02) - **Walker Willis**

Honestly, it feels like we got I would like to kick the can on this, basically, like we kind of need to progress David with being these designs wrapped up getting this in front of, you know, a couple of VPCs to quote and all that.

And I don't think that's going to make let's do diesel. That's fine. If the battery can participate in demand response, and you know, we can make it work otherwise.

And like, let's, let's look at that. I'm assuming it's the requirement in demand response is just a responsiveness like diesel isn't that fast.

I don't think they let you run diesel for the demand response program. Yeah, you know, they don't want you just running those generators.

  

[@32:45](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=1965.42) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Look, look at Senate bill for I think it's 480. And it was just passed and ratified, I guess, in July, and it's to accelerate the utilization of Oklahoma State of Oklahoma's natural gas resources.

Yeah. Let's burn it.

  

[@33:03](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=1983.84) - **Walker Willis**

Either way, I think this is something we've got to kind of expand on a little bit. Yeah, yeah, for right now.

The batteries do, I think, present the opportunity still, but let's put it in for the moment. Yeah, okay.

  

[@33:18](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=1998.34) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Continuing down to electrical, anything else that you want to cover? Erik, Muhammad, do want to talk about UPS layouts or N plus one?

  

[@33:24](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2004.94) - **Erik Stockglausner**

No, I think the important thing is for these guys to understand that we've tried to create a critical infrastructure design that has optionality.

And what I think sometimes we've got another client that's doing this, they're looking at rack layouts and office space layouts.

And I keep trying to go back and we don't even have an electrical design approach. We don't have a single line diagram that everybody says, yes, we want that.

We don't have a mechanical design that says, yes, we want that. And so they're putting the cart before the horse.

We're trying to do is make sure that we've got a topology and a modular design that gives you optionality.

So. Customer doesn't want to use those cabinets. They can use their own or something else. We're just creating the facility cooling capability for them.

Yeah, that's great. And we're creating the electrical infrastructure that's automated for the most part, self-healing. So there's not a whole lot of extra work that needs to go into it.

Yeah. Right. If a leg fails, the other one picks it up and it heals. And then it's like, okay, we need to go figure out what happened at that leg.

But the data center is not at risk of going down right then.

  

[@34:27](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2067.03) - **David Nocella**

What did you guys, I know last week we were talking about the batteries. being our UPS.

  

[@34:35](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2075.49) - **Erik Stockglausner**

So it's doable, but in order to upgrade the BEST system to be tier three compliant, it takes, it's a significant investment and it wouldn't provide enough ride through to eliminate the need for generators.

In fact, there's not a lot you can do to build enough BEST system to eliminate the need for generators because at night you don't have any, you can always store so much in the battery capability that have.

  

[@34:59](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2099.13) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

So if you, if you have to maintain that. Yeah. So just in case, then you can't cycle that battery to power your data center.

And once the solar starts to become fully consumed by the data center, then you've bought all that extra battery.

And, you know, after two years, you're just sitting on battery that's not getting used, you know, it's like, it's just like, there's not enough time to pay off the investment.

Okay, fair enough.

  

[@35:20](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2120.04) - **David Nocella**

So we're using more traditional UPS in the building, sure.

  

[@35:25](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2125.4) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah, we spent a good amount of time trying to model that to make it work. So it was a really cool idea.

But at the end of the day, it was like, well, money, the money's not going to line up, right?

It's all good.

  

[@35:36](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2136.48) - **David Nocella**

Yep.

  

[@35:39](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2139.06) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Mechanical systems. So I think there's, as we mentioned, you had in the other model, like an adiabatic evaporative cooling, we went with the zero water strategy, I think that's important.

And then the cooling strategy is like, mostly air cooling before non dense racks, but then having that infrastructure ready for any, you know, direct to chip cooling.

Okay. Those coolers that we've selected, they need to be engineered and designed for the specific space and climate and yada yada, so there is a whole other process to go and, like, tailor exactly what they are, but for the most part, you can call out what they are.

Yeah, I can even click over. Actually, I don't have mechanical up here right now, but we can click into that and see the details, and, like, your engineers will be able to kind of figure out exactly what goes into it, but there is a free cooling capability, so when the temperature drops to a certain amount, you get a certain amount of free cooling each year, which is nice.

Which helps your PUE.

  

[@36:34](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2194.31) - **David Nocella**

Great. Accility construction.

  

[@36:39](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2199.05) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

So, this was, we talked a little bit about the roofing and the wall structure. So, there's another financial calculation here.

I think it's going to work out well on the insurance side, not to mention the fact that data centers are just long-term buildings and having good solid structure is not a bad idea.

um, I don't have the per square foot costs. I think we need to do a bit of confirmation to work this into the model officially from a financial perspective, but a recommended perspective from the various ratings agencies is that you want a certain slab, a certain wall, and a certain roof, and these are all tornado-rated buildings.

So we've gone with kind of the top structure. Obviously, these decisions are very easy to reverse at this point in time, right?

Like you can just say, you literally just change the words on the screen and then it changes. So obviously, once you start building, it's a much different story, but for now, that's kind of where we are, and we're going to move forward with this type of roofing, this type of structure.

And then ceiling height, I think it's about 30 feet, gives you room up overhead, feels spacious, gives you that room for that center knock space.

It's not that big of a ceiling, actually, when you think about a warehouse. public, volume. I But. But it's, you know, it gives you a nice feeling in there.

  

[@38:07](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2287.02) - **David Nocella**

Everything honestly looks fine to me, except the precast concrete tilt-up structure. Is that common? Oh, yeah. Okay.

  

[@38:17](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2297.54) - **Erik Stockglausner**

In fact, a lot of data centers today are being built like parking garages, where not only is a tilt-up precast, the beam is a precast beam like you'd find in a parking garage.

Okay. We're not suggesting necessarily we go that to that extent, but we, there's going to be a FM 1-150 grader roof.

So structurally, it's going to have to support a lot. If you're concerned about sustainability, there are some sustainable concrete alternatives out there.

Yeah. We've also given some thought to how we can avoid concrete in some of the areas around the building.

So if that's a concern that you want us to incorporate, we certainly can. That's okay. Maybe I can put a little narrative.

  

[@38:53](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2333.88) - **David Nocella**

I'm, I'm somewhat familiar with different, different concrete additives that make it a little bit. More sustainable. Okay.

  

[@39:05](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2345.73) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Paying attention to that? No, no. I was just thinking from a CapEx perspective, honestly.

  

[@39:10](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2350.09) - **David Nocella**

I didn't know, you know, I was kind of picturing this more as like one of our operation maintenance buildings that we build on like wind farms where it's like a steel structure, like sheathing on the outside, but like that tornado room in the center is usually a concrete encased room, but that's fine.

If this is standard, that's fine. Yeah, we can certainly evaluate it.

  

[@39:35](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2375.97) - **Erik Stockglausner**

No, it's okay, Erik. Yeah. Okay. I wouldn't waste your time.

  

[@39:39](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2379.15) - **David Nocella**

If this is common, let's roll with it. Okay.

  

[@39:43](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2383.17) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah. I mean, obviously there's another level of modeling here when you start to look at specific material costs and room costs and all that stuff when you go through that with the architect.

So once again, would be easy to change if you find countermailing evidence. But it's also nice because the equipment inside those data halls is very expensive.

be easy to change. Sure. So if the tornado comes through, it's insurance-wise, when you've got a strong building, they do give you a real break.

Support spaces, I think we kind of covered this. I don't want go into too much, but I think when we get the full design picture, it'll probably be easier to go through in a picture than to kind of show you this.

But ultimately, we're spending a good amount of time in the next week on how do you access the yard?

How do you drive the trucks around? How do you make sure no one gets stuck? How do you refilled the diesel?

All that stuff that you got to think about. I think that's an important factor that's kind of there, but not fully there yet.

So that's to be determined exactly how we do that, work in that access. But the support spaces are all there, all designed.

I think they're in pretty good shape. So it would be up to your next architect to kind of go through all that with you guys if you wanted to kind of like just evaluate those spaces and think about how it works if you wanted to.

Okay. And once again, like if you guys have ideas, if you... When we send this over, and you're like, hey, would like to move this, we can grab our architect, and she can just jump on with us, and we can literally, like, move rooms around, and, you know, if you guys have ideas, it's your building, right?

Like, we could do a little design session.

  

[@41:14](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2474.77) - **David Nocella**

Maybe we could get some draft copies of all the designs, and we can maybe go through them next week and redline them, send back any comments or questions.

Perfect. Yeah, yeah, definitely.

  

[@41:27](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2487.07) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

I'll get her to wrap up a round.

  

[@41:31](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2491.41) - **David Nocella**

Yeah, they don't need to be a hundred percent done, just some, maybe something that can get us going on, on a review.

Like, close to what we've showed you today? Yeah. Yeah, perfect. No problem.

  

[@41:45](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2505.23) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

I don't think we need to talk about that. Did you guys get any more detail back on the natural gas line?

  

[@41:51](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2511.39) - **David Nocella**

No, I was, I tried to see if there was a local office when I was on site last week.

Um, it was not, they just had their big corporate office in Tulsa. Yeah. Yeah. So it's the one okay company or One Oak, I think is what they call it locally.

It's a huge corporation. So I don't know that we're going to find out a lot of information. I would just, can we just roll with some typical assumptions on, because there is that gas line that's like, was it two or four miles to the northwest that we did find another one.

And just right north of the project that goes east and west on that main pool. So there's plenty of like infrastructure and network, you know, there's, we documented all kinds of power lines, natural gas lines, fiber lines, all around the project last week.

Okay. Yeah, I wouldn't spend time there. I wouldn't, I mean, if we're going to go diesel too, like, we don't need to spend time there.

  

[@42:54](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2574.62) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

I'm just kind of curious if it did exist, because you were looking into it. I think the general, um, of what, like typical low rates.

  

[@43:01](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2581.26) - **David Nocella**

I think If for gas lines around Oklahoma, maybe we could just roll with an assumption there. Yeah, we have that problem.

  

[@43:09](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2589.1) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

And we don't really, if we're not generating with it, we don't really need it. Erik, were you going to try to do a generation like a facility generator?

I saw you were adding some stuff around that.

  

[@43:18](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2598.86) - **Erik Stockglausner**

So I went ahead and put in an app gas generator for the for the base building for so the office areas and any areas that are not considered part of the data center.

The critical I.T. load should be completely bifurcated and separate from the infrastructure, you know, that supports that. And so usually we have what I call a house dinner or a baby gen.

I put two natural gas gens in there as redundant backup for office space in case you do have the power outage.

You've got backup power for the office lights and the knock and things like that. Makes sense. Yeah. So that would be the main use of the natural gas line, but obviously.

  

[@43:55](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2635.64) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

That could be diesel too.

  

[@43:57](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2637.96) - **Erik Stockglausner**

It could be easy. Yeah, exactly. That's easy.

  

[@44:04](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2644.81) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

All right. Fire protection. This is like a whole thing in data centers, obviously, because it's very important. There's a lot of detail behind this.

We're trying to keep it fairly concise for this stage, but we did give you a good amount of details.

So there is a full fire expression spec, which you would expect. Most of it, I think we went dry pipe right over the data hall.

it's basically like water sprinklers, but with dry pipe. So, you know, when the right conditions trigger, then, you know, water would go in, but it's less possibility for a leak.

  

[@44:40](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2680.89) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Each cabinet is kind of its own NEMA enclosure. So it has its own integrated fire suppression. The power delivery modules have their own integrated fire suppression.

So essentially, we tried to keep it as simple as possible. It will be a requirement, I'm sure, for building code to have some fire suppression in the data halls, but we'd want those to be zoned pre-action dry pipe systems just to...

you know, prevent the accidental charging of the pipe or the discharge of water. I have a, I feel pretty confident if you were to go the design that we think we're going to go, it will, you're never going to have a real issue with it.

Yeah.

  

[@45:17](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2717.0) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

And then in, in the actual design, you can see there's in either corner, there's a fire riser room that's accessible from the outside, which the fire department would have a key to, you know, we're not seeing what you're not seeing what you're showing.

  

[@45:27](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2727.6) - **Erik Stockglausner**

There you go. Uh, I can show that really here. I thought maybe you were trying to show.

  

[@45:32](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2732.18) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

was painting a picture, but I'll show a picture. Um, there you go. So like, here's one right here, exit exterior door.

And then the other ones up here.

  

[@45:43](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2743.54) - **David Nocella**

Okay.

  

[@45:45](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2745.34) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

So fire is organized. Um, the other cool thing, which I don't know if insurance will will think of it as a, a bonus, but with those outdoor electrical enclosures.

You know, one of the batteries, lithium ion batteries are obviously a fire risk and they're away from your expensive equipment and outside and their own little contained unit.

So even if you have a problem with one lithium ion battery or some fire situation going on in one electrical zone, like you can literally might even be able to just close the vents on that thing and just smother that fire in a little building.

You know what I mean? It gives you like a real ability to kind of be safe. Um, when some of the things that are potentially going to catch fire, I don't think you're going to have a fire thing, but at some point, if we do find another insurance person, maybe that's a, it's a good modeling option to get a discount there.

  

[@46:41](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2801.13) - **David Nocella**

Yep.

  

[@46:43](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2803.13) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Um, we do, I don't want to go through costs yet because I want to go through them again. We've got a couple of different versions of money.

Um, so I don't want to, Eric, Eric, me and you need to go through those together. think.

  

[@47:00](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2820.11) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yeah. Unless you.

  

[@47:01](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2821.5) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

I comfortable enough to present them, but I just wanted to go back through that. Which one is this? I'm sorry.

  

[@47:07](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2827.14) - **Erik Stockglausner**

I mean, we were getting into like phased costs.

  

[@47:09](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2829.94) - **David Nocella**

Yeah. Yeah.

  

[@47:10](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2830.78) - **Erik Stockglausner**

So this is all based on the current design, but I think there's still some value engineering we can incorporate.

Like if we can get a more standard U.S. type voltage and those gens are available, then, you know, there's going to be savings there.

So I'm doing some of that analysis and I'll put that in an appendix so you guys can see what we do.

And I also put together an appendix for the demand response in Senate Bill 280. So I'll share that with you as well.

Great.

  

[@47:37](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2857.02) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Just for your information.

  

[@47:38](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2858.36) - **Muhammed Kurt**

Let's on that one. Go ahead, Monique. Just for your information, Walker, diesel generator voltages typically end at 13.8 kV.

So that's why we are at that voltage level. So we probably have to step down from this. The 34.5 KV to 13.8 KV at the data center.

Okay.

  

[@48:11](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2891.06) - **Walker Willis**

Okay. Yeah. It's good to know. This is, yeah, this is going to be a thing to solve for sure.

Just kind of like how do we match all those most efficiently and get them together without like five different transformers going.

  

[@48:26](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2906.62) - **Muhammed Kurt**

I I understand the 34.5 KV because you have long distances in EV generation, but the data center is much more compact.

Right. That's why it's not that typical to have these high voltages. Yeah. Or at least for the diesel generation.

If you use low voltage generators, then we don't have this problem. But, yeah. Thanks.

  

[@49:02](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2942.33) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

So, Muhammed, you were talking about, when we were talking about that line diagram to be made later this week, is this something that you could sort of encompass in there and like take a shot at what you would think might work based on what Walker's saying?

  

[@49:17](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2957.09) - **Muhammed Kurt**

Or do you think maybe it's like what you guys talking about together or what do you think the best way to do it?

No, I think I can create something to demonstrate very easily. Okay, perfect.

  

[@49:33](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2973.61) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah, so we'll take a quick shot and then I'm sure that you guys will have plenty of discussion around that.

  

[@49:39](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2979.27) - **Muhammed Kurt**

Yeah, I'm sure you guys haven't heard about it, but in Germany they have started building data centers made out of wood.

Erik saw that as well. Really? Not in Oklahoma.

  

[@49:54](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=2994.25) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yeah, I wouldn't recommend it. Okay, thank you. you. That's what insurance is for, right?

  

[@50:05](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=3005.82) - **Muhammed Kurt**

Well, it's pretty safe for fire, even if you think that it is not, but they made it very safe.

  

[@50:19](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=3019.9) - **Aaron Oldham**

In Oklahoma, the chances of the data center ending up in the Land of Oz through a tornado is a little too bad for a book.

  

[@50:31](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=3031.68) - **Muhammed Kurt**

That's true as well.

  

[@50:34](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=3034.62) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Okay, so we'll submit that generator in diesel. We'll look at the line diagram first before we recommend the specific transformer systems.

Then we'll go back and we'll double check this. Do you guys have any thoughts on, like, what is your best plan?

I guess my first question would be, like, do you ever do what Did ever do solar without a bus?

I'm just curious. I wouldn't recommend it, but I'm just curious, like, is that something you guys do? And then you'd also mentioned you had that alternate vendor that you were pursuing that had, like, on-site, like, they could drop compute on-site and suck down extra solar.

Like, have you progressed those conversations at all, or are those probably not worth going into?

  

[@51:27](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=3087.15) - **David Nocella**

Sorry, the second part's not really ringing a bell, Walker. Aaron. Aaron, what was the name of that company?

  

[@51:33](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=3093.61) - **Aaron Oldham**

The Rune Energy. Oh, the crypto miners?

  

[@51:37](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=3097.57) - **David Nocella**

Yeah. Yeah, the crypto miners.

  

[@51:39](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=3099.87) - **Aaron Oldham**

Well, it's crypto and distributed compute services. I mean, it's a little bit more.

  

[@51:46](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=3106.61) - **David Nocella**

Yeah, we've looked at that as, like, maybe when we're curtailed, we could divert our power to that as a secondary revenue source.

But, yeah, solar, you know, lots of solar projects. gonna things about Yeah. I without battery storage. A lot of the smaller projects that we're currently developing, like community solar size, like five megawatt projects, they don't typically have a battery component to them.

But with the larger utility scale, it does seem to provide some benefit. And so most of the projects we're currently modeling is a hybrid.

  

[@52:23](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=3143.92) - **Erik Stockglausner**

I mean, there's nothing to prevent you guys from creating a route for, you know, kind of on demand power for those intermittent type of workloads that don't necessarily have to have power 24 seven.

You know, I just don't know to what extent it would be worth it for you. It depends, I guess, on what you negotiate the power purchase agreement with the provider or the consumer is.

So, yeah, so there's nothing that wouldn't, especially if we're going to have grid connection and we'd like to consume the solar, but we recognize that we probably won't be able to consume it all at the peak of the day.

Pres of amazing, And we won't have enough at night. So yeah, absolutely.

  

[@53:05](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=3185.76) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah, I did some modeling just because I'm a nerd and I was trying to figure out how much do they actually pay and how much, you know, what size best do you actually really want?

Because if you only have three megawatts running for like a year and then you step it up, you know, there's not like the sizing of your best can be a big outlay for CapEx, right?

So figuring out how you size that and what energy is curtailed versus what's captured and how much is provided to your overall data center.

And, you know, there's a whole calculation there. Walker, that's probably right up in your alley. But if you do start to do that, I can send you over some of the docs that I was playing with.

But, you know, for now, we're assuming there is one. We don't need it, though, because we have our UPSs and our gens.

So, you know, it's mostly there to kind of take advantage of the solar that's in place. And you would probably want to cycle that battery.

  

[@54:08](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=3248.35) - **Erik Stockglausner**

The other thing that's important to remember is that the total consumption of the building, IT plus overhead, is not necessarily going to be three megawatts if we have three megawatts deployed.

That's three megawatts of capacity. What you'll find is that the client might rent a full three megawatts of capacity and literally consume on average one and a half.

And so that number times your PUE is where you get your total utility. So just because it's three megawatts doesn't mean you're going to have four and a half megawatts of load.

You're probably going to have something substantially less than that because unless they're running full bore AI, you know, seismic data processing or crypto, they're not going to consume 100% of the power.

Yeah.

  

[@55:01](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=3301.76) - **Aaron Oldham**

And the more that I investigate this market, the enterprise workload is kind of going to be the likely scenario for the customer base that we approach it.

  

[@55:15](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=3315.96) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Right, but it's at StocksPoint, they still probably wouldn't be using all their available power all the time.

  

[@55:22](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=3322.72) - **Aaron Oldham**

Yeah, they very much trend toward under use at night. And that helps us because of our generation strategy and our storage strategy.

It could help you or it could just mean you curtail more.

  

[@55:38](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=3338.7) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

It depends on where you're at. know what mean? your size is your best and all that.

  

[@55:42](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=3342.24) - **Aaron Oldham**

Yeah, that's true.

  

[@55:43](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=3343.14) - **Muhammed Kurt**

place the number here, the global average of data center power utilization is around 66%. Yeah.

  

[@55:56](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=3356.68) - **Erik Stockglausner**

And that includes a lot of cloud, which they do a pretty good job optimizing their workloads. They're probably getting closer.

bye. Bye Bye Thank So I would say that that average is skewed up considerably by cloud and now AI.

So this facility, the way we've designed the facility gives you an option to go after enterprise, gives you an option to go after enterprise or neocloud, you know, so there's a lot of flexibility in the design.

We expect the cabinet that we call a DDC cabinet that's made by Great Lakes, and I think it's now been bought by Vertiv, so that doesn't have to be that product, you can still do rear or heat exchanger, what we try to do is create an infrastructure that is agnostic enough that you can put whatever you need in there, even including crawl units, if you want to devise a data hall and put standard crawl units in there, we can accommodate that as well and hot aisle containment or whatever.

So the goal is to create something where your customer can come in and literally create their own environment that matches their need.

Okay.

  

[@57:06](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=3426.06) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

All right. So I guess, you know, the bigger things are, as you guys have more conversations with your, you know, Camelot, Chillin' Hill, and all that, like, understanding those details would be helpful.

Like, grid power day one, that would be, you know, we'll go with that assumption, but also it's like, I think that the interconnection agreement is probably important, too.

Like, what does that look like? So it's like, what are you going to do with that excess solar if you're curtailing it?

Is there, like, a way to send it back to the grid and get wholesale price? Would you use the Rune Energy thing?

You know, what are the options there? Like, and if you had some of those, you know, mobile edge computers compute on there, is that going to be a problem for, I don't know, any of the other infrastructure that relates to the grid?

Probably not. But, ultimately, think that understanding more about Your grid connection, and I have some details I can send over, and the notion doc is pretty helpful just to kind of close that gap.

think that's the biggest unknown risk in my mind at this moment.

  

[@58:16](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=3496.94) - **David Nocella**

Yeah. Walker, what are your thoughts? Would that be helpful to get some of that information?

  

[@58:28](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=3508.42) - **Walker Willis**

Sorry, I repeat the question. What information? was like, you know, we're talking about the grid interconnection and whether we're able to push energy back onto the grid.

That would be one. Like, what are you going to do with energy if you have extra?

  

[@58:43](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=3523.92) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

You're probably not going to have the best size to capture everything. So would you just curtail or dump it?

Or would you try to, like, get a wholesale? Push back to the grid. Is that even possible? don't know.

I mean, Erik was looking at some things saying that utility scale often doesn't allow it, but I don't know if you guys know Oklahoma that well.

  

[@59:01](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=3541.89) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Well, current legislation limits you to, I think, 300 kilowatts, and it's designed for, like, rooftop solar to allow residential users to, you know, sell back to the grid.

Right.

  

[@59:12](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=3552.11) - **Walker Willis**

I guess I don't really see a scenario where we have excess energy. It may be in the first year, right?

But, like, if we're designing 12 megawatts of solar capacity and we have some battery capacity, I haven't done the modeling.

But, you know, my experience would suggest that, like, we're never going to have excess energy to push back. Don't worry about it.

Yeah, just early on.

  

[@59:42](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=3582.45) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah.

  

[@59:43](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=3583.09) - **Walker Willis**

Yeah, again, maybe in the first year when we only have the first tenant in place, there will be curtailment.

But I think that's pretty minimal. And the value there that we're going to be able to get from selling back to the grid is going to be pretty low because it's going to be wholesale rates.

So, and then.

  

[@1:00:04](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=3604.5) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Are you guys anticipating setting up a power purchase agreement with your tenants for power?

  

[@1:00:12](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=3612.06) - **David Nocella**

I think what we talked about, I'm sorry, what's it called? Like a pass-through, we were talking about this today.

  

[@1:00:20](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=3620.96) - **Erik Stockglausner**

So most wholesale tenants want to do what we call modified gross plus E data center leases. So they want to lease the capacity.

I want to lease three megawatts, right? And then I want to pay for power based on what it's metered to me at, right?

So I only want to pay for what I use. And they're either going to negotiate an agreement directly with the power provider, or you're going to negotiate it and say, here's the price of power here, we've already pre-negotiated it.

If you're going to set up your own solar plant and a vest system, and if you have the ability under Senate Bill, I think it's 280, to island, you can literally sell back to that data center through a PPA.

To power you generate.

  

[@1:01:01](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=3661.95) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Okay? You're allowed to do that now.

  

[@1:01:03](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=3663.71) - **Erik Stockglausner**

can self-generate and sell to an entity there. You just can't sell to the retail market. So that's why I was trying to model that to determine the economics of the best system and how that would work and whether, and again, if you, then if you wanted to also participate in demand response, you have to have a natural gas component to it.

So you have to have some sort of turbines or something there that will allow you to do that. And that could be several hundred thousand dollars a year.

So, you know, there's a lot of, there's a lot of variables there based on the new legislation and some of the existing legislation.

And it's, it's a great time to, to be in this place because it could mean the economics for your solar plant becomes much more favorable because you can sell it, you can sell it directly to the data center at a, at a reasonable price, maybe a small premium because it's renewable.

Um, but a blended rate would, would, you know, be sub 10 cents.

  

[@1:01:58](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=3718.21) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Right. And also I think you can have. You could literally just put in a couple natural gas generators and qualify and use the rest diesel, Erik.

The only time you'd use those natural gas generators is when the grid demanded it.

  

[@1:02:11](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=3731.64) - **Erik Stockglausner**

So, hey, we're having a peak issue. We need you to go on generators, spin up the termites, and they write you a check.

  

[@1:02:18](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=3738.66) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Or you could actually maybe model it. So you just hold some of that best in reserve, depending if there's a natural possibility of outages and you know it's going to be a hot day.

You don't cycle that early. cycle it later and during demand response and you use your battery during that time.

  

[@1:02:38](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=3758.6) - **Erik Stockglausner**

That makes sense.

  

[@1:02:40](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=3760.48) - **Muhammed Kurt**

This also depends on which state you are in, right? Like some states will have more demand requests than others.

Yeah.

  

[@1:02:49](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=3769.98) - **Erik Stockglausner**

So most time the utility will pay you for the right to ask you to go into island mode, to just shed that load.

Now, I mean, what they'll pay you depends on how much load you can shed. Right. Because if they need 10 megawatts, you only have two, it doesn't help them a whole lot.

We ran into that situation in the line data centers when I was there. But sometimes there's incentives, like they'll give you an incentive, they'll help you purchase the net gas generators.

So there's a lot of different ways that this could be potentially negotiated with the grid provider that gives you an advantage.

And if you get to keep the demand response dollars as the generator, that gives you a net increase in the price that you're getting, essentially.

So it goes from like some 10 cents or 10 cents to maybe 17 cents per kilowatt hour with demand response.

So it makes the economics of the solar system look a lot better. And you still accomplish this.

  

[@1:03:44](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=3824.06) - **David Nocella**

I think there's definitely a lot of nuances with how the PPA and LGIA will be structured that we're honestly unsure of at this moment.

So I, correct me if I'm wrong here, Walker, but we'll probably model something very simple. Like he was saying, with just, you know, 100% of the capacity going, you know, to the utility through PPA, we're not really modeling curtailment at the moment and what kind of, like, separate revenue that could provide or what that rate change could be.

Is that right, Walker? want maybe just keep it a little simple at this point on the revenue side of the ledger?

Right.

  

[@1:04:31](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=3871.63) - **Walker Willis**

And it's going to take a while to peel all this back. like, I, yeah, yeah. We've got to kind of build out what we can produce and then talk to the utility and kind of build up from there.

I'm not ready to say these are all good options to have on the table, but like, you know, again, I focus on the core of getting this designed and, you know, we know what some of production modeling is, you know what the battery's on.

Okay. Now let's start peeling.

  

[@1:05:11](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=3911.58) - **Erik Stockglausner**

I was just trying to understand, because when I asked you, I think in the last call, if you were going to model the investment analysis for the data center separate from the generation, you said, yeah, they'll do separate investment analysis.

Then there's a revenue component of the generation side. Is that revenue tied to, it's obviously going to tied to the data center tenant.

They're going to be on the hook to buy the power. Right. And they're going to, they're going to want to have at least some knowledge of what that cost is going to be to them.

So the economics in your returns, your internal rate of return are going to be dependent to some degree on how much the tenants willing to pay for the solar energy and or if you're able to do demand response.

These are all things that we're just mentioning to you, not saying you have to go this route, but that are changing.

legislation just was enacted and it could be an opportunity for you to improve the economics of your of your generation.

While at the same time, providing relief for the grid when it's really, really necessary. Yeah, no, you're totally spot on, Erik.

  

[@1:06:08](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=3968.09) - **David Nocella**

And we've been, we've been, Marcus on our team is kind of running with our financial modeling. He hasn't been a part of these calls, but I think starting after next week, he's out of town for a few days, but he does want to get looped in with you guys, especially with this like basis design that we're going through today, because he's going to work with our other consultant on the financial modeling and update, you know, and a lot of this information from you guys on the design is going to inform that, but you're, you're, you're totally spot on, Erik, you know, whether or not we have enough time to peel all those layers back in the next three weeks, I don't know.

So we may just take a simple approach. It's a good question to ask. So like, are we for the solar and batteries, are we generating power and selling it direct to the utility?

And then the data centers buying it from the utility, or are we selling it to the data center? Yeah.

And then Whatever extra is going to the utility, these are questions that our team needs to answer for you, probably by early next week.

If maybe something that could help us, we know how to model the PPA pricing for this area of the country.

We know what typical PPA rates are for solar and capacity charge rates for the batteries would be. But I guess what one thing that maybe help us to answer this question for you is if you have any sense of like the going rate of what a client would pay for, I don't know if you call it your triple net, triple N, you know, your electric gas.

  

[@1:07:41](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=4061.6) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Modified gross plus E, which would be, hey, we're going to buy the power based on what we consume. So that market rate and then Aaron can probably give us more color on this.

But I think I've modeled, I've actually done some of this investment analysis. I'm happy to go through that and your investment guy or financial guy can keep what he wants and throw away what he doesn't.

No. Ultimately, I think we can get, I think, $155 a KW per month is a reasonable market rate rent for an enterprise tier three concurrently maintainable data center with Cloud OnRamp.

Is that rent?

  

[@1:08:17](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=4097.92) - **David Nocella**

That's that's all right. That's just no, that's just rent.

  

[@1:08:20](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=4100.8) - **Erik Stockglausner**

And then they're going to pay for power and typically charge a small administration fee to meter the power and give them a second power bill.

We were talking about that yesterday and I was mentioning that the markets like if we may want to tack.

  

[@1:08:32](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=4112.06) - **David Nocella**

On like a small administration fee, you know, to it's not going to just be our, our standard PPA rate with the utility.

No, that's great. $155 a KW, I think you said for rent. Do you have an idea of what a client would pay for power?

If they wanted like a three, three megawatt capacity load, what, what would they, what would the go in rate in Oklahoma be for that?

Do you know? That's a good question.

  

[@1:09:01](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=4141.8) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Maybe. I'll pull the data real quick if I had to guess, if I had to guess pure renewables going to come at a slight premium because that's something somebody wants.

So I'm guessing I've been guessing at about 10 cents anywhere between nine and 12 cents a kilowatt hours. I've modeled excluding excluding demand response revenue.

  

[@1:09:25](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=4165.67) - **David Nocella**

Okay, yeah, Aaron, let's let's look into that after this call. And, you know, I think a lot of the co-ops, you know, post their their rates, their rate schedules.

So we can also look at that as like a comparison of what just grid power would typically cost to a commercial or industrial customer.

I've got a polling right now, so give me just one second.

  

[@1:09:52](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=4192.47) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Okay.

  

[@1:09:54](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=4194.63) - **Aaron Oldham**

David, 8.1 cents, 8.1 cents per kilowatt hour in MUB prior. So it's dirt cheap. to 15 great. Bye What's the source?

That's the MUB prior data, Municipal Utility Board prior.

  

[@1:10:13](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=4213.0) - **Erik Stockglausner**

So, I mean, if you came in at that or even slightly below that, you're bringing in that benefit to the tenant.

And if you're able to island through some sort of, you know, micro turbine strategy, now you get, that goes to 12 or 14.

And so here is what they say is the caveat.

  

[@1:10:35](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=4235.34) - **Aaron Oldham**

There is a power cost adjustment fee based on the timeline of utilization. And so their typical rate is 11.17.

So that, that is the 8.1 is, is, is the base rate. And then what the actual data shows is 11.17 to 11.72.

So their data. littleças to each event littleprender. Their data is variable here, and from my understanding, that's common in all of the markets that, you know, that Vantage navigated as well, so.

  

[@1:11:18](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=4278.67) - **Walker Willis**

We just have to think about capacity as well, like, right? It's not just energy, it's capacity when you're getting power from the grid.

So, when we're looking at, you know, $155 per kilowatt, like, that's a capacity value per month, you know? And we're, our energy, energy is different than power, so we just got to consider that, David.

As we look at our modeling, like, yeah, we're going to have cents per kilowatt hour, but we also need dollars per kilowatt month included.

So, that's internal for us to, to kind of make sure we're modeling correctly. Yeah, Walker, if you want to...

  

[@1:12:02](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=4322.3) - **Aaron Oldham**

If grab time on my calendar this afternoon, we can dig into that.

  

[@1:12:06](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=4326.72) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Do you guys have a target internal rate of return that you want for each asset? Are you looking at like 10 plus, you know, want double-digit returns, or are you?

  

[@1:12:15](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=4335.84) - **David Nocella**

You know, for most solar plus battery projects that we model, I think we're around like the 11 to 12 percent.

  

[@1:12:22](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=4342.46) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Okay. Any idea what you're looking for or if your investor, what your investor might be looking for on the data center side?

Given this is the first one, I think we're unsure.

  

[@1:12:36](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=4356.34) - **David Nocella**

So wherever the numbers come out is wherever the numbers come out, I guess. I would hope maybe, you know, at least small double digits, 10, 11, 12 percent.

I think we can get you better than that.

  

[@1:12:49](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=4369.58) - **Erik Stockglausner**

I think we can get you closer to 15. Okay. I think if you were to do the islanding strategy with the micro turbines, I think you can increase your I think you can probably get close to that.

  

[@1:13:10](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=4390.44) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

So when you guys are doing that calculation, like I saw how you did it in the spreadsheet, are you still thinking about kind of like a per kilowatt calculation or like we, I mean, we have this at this point, this design that we could almost get to equipment in this level and like take a guess at the cost, like a range cost for equipment.

And that would kind of give you a really good validation there as opposed to just using like, you know, rule of thumb percentages.

Yeah.

  

[@1:13:44](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=4424.4) - **David Nocella**

You know, we were kind of talking about this yesterday. I'm like, how much, you know, how much detail do we want to get to, I guess, you know, whatever budget and time allows will take as much, you know, granularity as you're able to provide.

But, you know, one thing that Walker was kind of mentioned. And I agree with is we do want to be able to, like, take this all the work that we've done on this project and be able to, like, kind of rinse and repeat it a little bit.

So we do want to be able to replicate it somewhat easily and not have to go, you know, line by line by line on, you know, this building is going to have three of this and two of this as opposed, you know, so if there is a simplistic way, you know, on one hand, we would love to have the detailed information.

And then in practicality, we would like to have, you know, something that's easily updated in the future if we were to change, you know, instead of 120 acres, we have a 240 acre property.

We could easily adjust some things and metrics and, you know, my mind goes to, okay, well, if we think about it simplistically, it's like, this is a cost per square foot.

We could easily scale things, is where my head goes, but I also do- no, I like this. I have two thoughts on that.

  

[@1:15:15](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=4515.22) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

First thought, I think you need both, and I think that getting to the level of equipment level, we're not talking about wall plates, we're talking about a generator, you know what I mean, or a chiller, which they're expensive things, so having that ability to pressure test your percentages, or your numbers per kilowatt, I think that makes sense.

And then when you guys are in that range, you can kind of run with that more comfortably for Oklahoma, because we're going to have to design that anyways, right?

So I don't think it's that big of a lift. So I think having both is nice. And then two, I think that with the amount of detail that we send over to you guys, you'll be able to take it and pretty easily reuse a lot of this stuff as kind of a So

This is designed for future projects. I think that the space we've laid out, it's very swappable, if you will, if you had that space on your land.

So I think that's totally possible. And so yeah, I think that it's not that much more work to get to that level.

I'll revisit the budget and make sure that we're not going to blow it or anything. I don't think we are.

And then I think you guys will have that. But my question, this what I'm getting to, is your investor, is the investor or investors, plural, are they going to want to see that level of detail, you think?

Or do you think that they're at this phase, okay, with like, you know, kind of percentages and ROM? Yeah, I think they're more okay with the ROM.

  

[@1:16:50](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=4610.35) - **David Nocella**

But I think internal to us, we would love to be able to have the more detailed information, if questions come up in the future, like, how did you get to this number?

that works? Yeah. don't We can, we can explain, you know, everything that went into it.

  

[@1:17:08](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=4628.54) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

So is it really this one guy who's going to just plop down all the money for this, you think, or is it going to be like a group of folks?

He's got, he's got a, yeah, a network of folks.

  

[@1:17:17](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=4637.82) - **David Nocella**

Okay. He like lead investor, basically.

  

[@1:17:20](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=4640.2) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yeah. Yeah. They, they know some folks that are pretty wealthy. So what I've modeled here, and again, this is just preliminary, but we did model solar plus best 10 year cashflow based on just two megawatts of capacity.

So we'll tweak these numbers based on the basis of design, but ultimately you've got a 11.8% internal rate of return.

That's a, that's an unlevered return. So when you do capital, you equity and financing, that's going to improve your, you know, your equity multiple.

But, um, right now we're at, you know, 11.8 on the solar plus best, and you might decide to do less best or, you know, something like that.

And then it also depends on if the micro turbines are involved. Um, But ultimately, the data center returns we're showing right now are closer to 20, you know, so there's some flexibility in there, and we've got to retweak some of these numbers, this is probably a little bit high right now, but the net net is, there's definitely some double digit returns, I think, on both sides if you do it right.

That's great.

  

[@1:18:23](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=4703.26) - **David Nocella**

And, you know, I think, to summarize everything, we're going to try to blend those, you know, and look at this as like a whole project.

  

[@1:18:33](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=4713.06) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Potentially, I don't know.

  

[@1:18:35](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=4715.56) - **David Nocella**

The solar and the data center? Yeah, the rate of return on the solar and the data center, we may try to show them like, here's your solar, here's your best, here's your data center, and blend it together.

If you were to develop at all, you know, here's your IRR. Eric, that's great. You know, typically, we do only present unlevered financial models, so I wouldn't probably rack your brain too much about.

for got all these toêta Thank you. Leveraging it with different debt and tax equity scenarios. Given, again, similar to the PPA, we're going down a route that could take a lot of shapes and forms, and we don't know exactly, you know, how that would be structured.

So we just typically just show an unlevered model.

  

[@1:19:24](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=4764.43) - **Erik Stockglausner**

But all the models we've developed for the best in solar do include a demand response component and some level of demand response compensation, which we just basically estimated based on what we could find publicly.

Okay. Could be better, could be worse.

  

[@1:19:41](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=4781.65) - **David Nocella**

Perfect. Well, I think Walker's had to step away a little bit. I'm sure he's still listening. Are we in a good place?

I know. How are you guys feeling going into next week? Are there any questions that you need answers to today?

I'll go through the law. Benton later this afternoon, but is there anything, like, really pressing? I think the drawing for the substation is really key if you want us to not encroach on the solar farm.

  

[@1:20:15](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=4815.0) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yeah. So that's really important right now. And if we have to rearrange the loading dock, I don't think that's going to be too terribly difficult, but we may want to do a few things there to make sure that we can accommodate that.

So that's the biggest thing right now, I think. Okay. Yeah. Anything else? And I think that goes to you want renderings, right?

You want to see the three-dimensional rendering, so that building footprint is going to be critical to that. Yep. Yeah.

  

[@1:20:44](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=4844.62) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

That GCP conversation, Aaron, would be good to put that back on top of the list. I still think it's worth having a conversation to see what kind of fiber is available, because that could be a big cost.

And so it's a small risk in the overall scheme of things, but it is still material. Yeah.

  

[@1:21:02](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=4862.36) - **David Nocella**

Yeah. I was beginning to ask you about that. Walker had brought that up, I think, on Tuesday to me.

If there's any progression there with reaching out to Google. I've submitted a request and, you know, it's the email back and forth.

  

[@1:21:16](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=4876.47) - **Aaron Oldham**

I will schedule a call to get into depth. Yeah.

  

[@1:21:21](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=4881.75) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

One other little thing, the environmental consultant, are they going to go into air permissions, like permitting for diesel gins and stuff like that?

  

[@1:21:31](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=4891.19) - **David Nocella**

Yeah, they're going to provide a permitting matrix, which will highlight, you know, air quality permit, you know, probably on a county level that's likely going to be required.

And they'll give a quick little synopsis of who to reach out to kind of thing.

  

[@1:21:48](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=4908.11) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah, I'm not I'm not expecting it to be a problem there, but you never know. It's good to get it on the on the radar.

And then, Aaron, if you do get that GCP meeting, like definitely let us know what like the like if if someone's just.

  

[@1:22:06](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=4926.22) - **Aaron Oldham**

If I end up getting a call, can I loop you in, Benton, and we just have the… Yeah, course.

should do a little pre-call with everyone just to make sure that we're asking the right things.

  

[@1:22:16](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=4936.88) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

But basically, they probably know who the Fibre providers, they should know the Fibre providers that are putting in there.

Yeah.

  

[@1:22:24](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=4944.56) - **Aaron Oldham**

If we look at the Fibre locator data, we'll be able to pull that. Right. But I'm sure they work there, it's local, it's a person.

  

[@1:22:35](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=4955.54) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

If you can actually get a person there, they can probably say, oh, yeah, talk to this consultant, or these are the two that we would recommend.

Or maybe Fibre locator will have that. I don't know. But is there dark Fibre? Do we need to run Fibre?

What's the Fibre situation? What's basically the time to get the GCP Connect in Google? And I think those are all important things.

And I don't think it's going to be long, but I don't know because I've never done it.

  

[@1:23:00](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=4980.64) - **Aaron Oldham**

Yeah, it's generally not long. . . ? Because we're right along the fiber pathway there, and Dave and I scouted it, and there are fiber drops for us to connect into right on the property.

So we'll be quickly deployed on that regard.

  

[@1:23:20](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5000.1) - **Erik Stockglausner**

So two more quick things, David and Walker and Aaron, included with our basis of design will be the logic and the why behind why we chose the components, equipment, the design that we did.

So you can confidently communicate that to your investor. Like, here's why we chose this particular voltage, this particular piece of equipment.

That's the first thing that will come along early to come in an appendix or come along in the executive summary.

The other thing that you will get is at least some reasonable level of confidence that whatever we present to you, even if, you know, based on returns and so on and so forth, everything we present to you is with the intent that it will improve, not get worse, right?

Barring Any crazy, you know, events that we have no control over, that's our goal, is to give you one, something that you can explain why to the investor, and also you can give to the investor with a level of confidence that the return won't go down, it will go up, ideally.

No, that's great, Erik. We take the same approach, honestly.

  

[@1:24:22](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5062.41) - **David Nocella**

We like to present a more conservative view, with maybe highlighting potential upside, rather than the opposite. We love that, you know, if you want to take a conservative view, and even highlight that in your basis of design, you know, in specific areas of revenue, or rent rates, or something, you know, if you want to even highlight that, you know, typical go and raise $160, but we went up with $155.

We like that kind of stuff to show that, like, there's some headroom.

  

[@1:25:01](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5101.07) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Unfortunately. Unfortunately. There's not a lot of market data in Oklahoma, least, there's some, don't get me wrong, it's probably going to be mostly retail, but there's not a lot around Neocloud and stuff like that, at least not that I'm aware of yet.

It's crypto, it's Google, and it's a few smaller data centers. Yeah, we do like that approach.

  

[@1:25:20](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5120.3) - **David Nocella**

We're glad you're doing it that way.

  

[@1:25:22](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5122.76) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Cool. And then as far as what you're presenting in the next couple of weeks, I mean, do you want any, the executive, you basically saw the executive summary type of view of basic design.

Is there anything that you would ask for to help you with your presentation deck or like, like any frameworks or any, if you have like something like a, even if you had something that you typically use to send over, it's like, if that's in my mind, I mean, Eric can like at least kind of usher the information that way.

  

[@1:25:54](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5154.38) - **David Nocella**

So it's kind of easy to push. Let me think about that. I think I'll have a better answer for you once stuff starts coming over and we have a chance to start.

And going through it and I might think of like, hey, what, this would be great to have kind of thing.

It'll probably happen at that point once we start reviewing everything. Yeah.

  

[@1:26:14](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5174.33) - **Erik Stockglausner**

In the interest of time and productivity, may I make a suggestion? Can we take some license with the substation footprint?

So it seemed like at least Walker was very, it was very important to Walker that we not encroach on the solar area.

Can we take some license with trying to compress that at least to a place where we feel like we can accommodate your need there?

Sure.

  

[@1:26:36](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5196.15) - **David Nocella**

Yeah, we're flexible here. And maybe, Erik, if you could suggest, like, draw a little hatched area of what you want to encroach on, that could maybe help Walker more quickly redesign the substation around that.

Yeah.

  

[@1:26:53](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5213.79) - **Erik Stockglausner**

If we can elongate it and squeeze it down to give you kind of a similar amount of square footage, you still have to consider the retention pond, which I don't know exactly what size that needs to be.

So, Thank

  

[@1:27:02](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5222.78) - **David Nocella**

So we need to do a little detailed research on that, but yeah, but maybe if you want to kind of present what's your, what would be ideal for you.

  

[@1:27:13](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5233.66) - **Walker Willis**

Let's see if we can work around what you need and we definitely can like, you know, the substation doesn't have to be a square.

can be a rectangle. can be an L shape, you know, like designed and built.

  

[@1:27:27](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5247.98) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yeah, there's a substation, there's a substation right to the north of you guys is where I imagine some of the power will come from my camera in the name of it.

We can use that footprint, I guess, and maybe add a little more to it if that's okay.

  

[@1:27:40](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5260.4) - **Walker Willis**

Yeah, mean, you know, Erik, honestly, like the substation is not going to need more than an acre. Like for this size of project, like we can, it can be small.

I've built a hundred and forty megawatt, you know, substation on three quarters of an acre. Like you can really squeeze stuff if you have to and an acre will allow.

It's just, they'll just use traditional open air equipment and, you know, for 20 megawatts, this, this will be more than enough.

Okay.

  

[@1:28:11](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5291.82) - **Erik Stockglausner**

We also have a, an exceptional substation guy. So if you get into a situation where you need some supplemental CM support or subject matter expertise around, you know, substation construction, we've got a really sharp guy who travels all over doing it.

So I don't know that you have that need. like you probably already have it baked, but if you do, I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't at mention it.

Yeah, no, appreciate that. All right.

  

[@1:28:40](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5320.78) - **David Nocella**

Yeah, no, this is all great guys. Really, really impressed. You know, I don't know what the plan is to maybe send over the basis of design, even if it's still in draft form.

But I do think maybe early next week, that would be great to get over to our financial modeler, just to have him start reading through all the changes.

there's, um, In the design, because you guys have gone into, it looks like, a lot more detail than what we gave him originally from the Schneider Electric reference, so I'm sure he'll need some time to go through that and kind of think about how that changes his CapEx estimate, so yeah, just putting that out there, if it's possible to get that at some point earlier in the week, next week, even if it is subject to change a little bit.

  

[@1:29:32](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5372.85) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Let us make the changes to the voltage because I think where I'm leaning now is probably more aligned with what Mohammed said is to go more standard, like 13.8 voltage on the MV side, but I'm going to double check that.

  

[@1:29:48](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5388.53) - **Muhammed Kurt**

Yeah, that came from what I've created here for a project in Europe.

  

[@1:29:55](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5395.61) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah, I want to see what the new version is, Mohammed.

  

[@1:29:59](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5399.61) - **Erik Stockglausner**

It's a train wreck. wreck. It's a wreck. I'll send you the...

  

[@1:30:02](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5402.88) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

The images today, and then we get the, as soon as Erik and Muhammed can get through that electric, then we can shoot the other thing over, because the electric is such a big part of that, I feel like it's worth spending a moment on.

  

[@1:30:14](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5414.52) - **David Nocella**

Yeah, yeah, no, do what you guys need to do, but yeah, if we could get something maybe by Wednesday of next week, that'd be great.

Oh, for sure, for sure, yeah, yeah, yeah, I was thinking like trying to get it Monday.

  

[@1:30:25](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5425.62) - **Aaron Oldham**

Yeah, and just to clarify, which of these two substations were you referring to in that reference? It was, it was, let me see here, I'm looking where the property is over there by the river bend, maybe.

so here, here's the property.

  

[@1:30:43](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5443.76) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Ah, okay, maybe that wasn't the one I was looking at, there was one farther to the north, because I just did a Google search, like substation, and it didn't come up with anything named, so that might be even closer.

Yeah, and Benton, you have access to all this, so.

  

[@1:30:58](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5458.28) - **Aaron Oldham**

Yeah, of course.

  

[@1:30:59](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5459.18) - **David Nocella**

Aaron, you and I drove to both ends of the substations that, that walk. We're just planning on interconnecting to ones to the south, ones for the north.

Do you need those locations, Erik? That would be helpful, yeah. If you want to send them to us, we could put that in the basis of design.

  

[@1:31:14](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5474.63) - **Erik Stockglausner**

And if you know the voltage of the power lines that we'll be tapping into, that would be helpful, too.

Because I'm assuming it's 138, but I see a bunch of different voltages there. Yeah, yeah.

  

[@1:31:26](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5486.23) - **Aaron Oldham**

And Benton, you have access to all the underlying data here, and I'll just circle the two. Just click on the substation real quick, and then click on the line.

  

[@1:31:36](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5496.39) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Just zoom in real quick. I'm just curious. I can pull it up, too, Erik. It's pretty easy, but just go in there and click on that orange power line.

  

[@1:31:47](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5507.91) - **Muhammed Kurt**

I can send you guys that info today, though.

  

[@1:31:50](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5510.87) - **David Nocella**

We've got 345 there. Nice. There you go.

  

[@1:31:54](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5514.53) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Do you guys get a benefit from taking power at high voltage on your own substation? Like, do you avoid transmission distribution charges like we do in Texas?

I don't know..com Oh No, Jesus. Oh Please,

  

[@1:32:04](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5524.38) - **David Nocella**

It probably depends on the area of the country. Walker, what do you know about it?

  

[@1:32:11](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5531.16) - **Walker Willis**

I guess I wouldn't know that we have much of an option to take power, not on the high voltage.

  

[@1:32:18](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5538.56) - **Erik Stockglausner**

The reason I mention it is at Digital Realty, we built a campus in Richardson, and one of the big selling points was that we had our own substation there, and we were taking power at high voltage.

So we avoid transmission distribution charges. On everybody's power bill, we have a T&D charge, and that's to cover the cost of the grid.

And because we weren't really connected to the distribution grid, we were connected directly to the high voltage. We saved our customers a lot of energy charges there.

And so it depends on what your utility bill looks like. If your utility bill has that extra piece, and it doesn't end up getting charged to them, that's another selling point when you're pitching it to the market.

It justifies higher rent. You can charge a little higher rent because of your total cost. Also, ownership is lower.

Yeah.

  

[@1:33:06](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5586.56) - **Walker Willis**

No, I think the same thing, Erik, like, you know, we're not by connecting the high voltage system, you're avoiding some of that, like distribution level, you know, utility charges, but that's where then it comes back to like, retail rate versus wholesale rate to sell the power back to the grid, you know, then you lose that benefit of kind of net, you know, quote, unquote, net metering of generation that can occur.

So, yeah.

  

[@1:33:36](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5616.54) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

So, Walker, the substation. I already got to jump now.

  

[@1:33:39](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5619.12) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Thanks, Muhammad. Okay. Yeah. No problem, Muhammad.

  

[@1:33:41](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5621.66) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

That substation on the bottom there, that was the one that was connected to 345. Was the other one just slightly north and slightly west?

Was that the one you guys went to look at, too? Yeah, don't quote me.

  

[@1:33:52](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5632.08) - **David Nocella**

Let me pull it up. Well, you should have looked at all of them, David, if you followed my instructions.

  

[@1:33:59](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5639.58) - **Walker Willis**

We did. Yeah.

  

[@1:34:01](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5641.56) - **David Nocella**

We went to each one. one. Okay. I don't think it's that one. It was right off of a county road.

I have a KMZ from Walker and I can look up what the voltages were. Yeah.

  

[@1:34:13](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5653.57) - **Erik Stockglausner**

We'll incorporate those if it's 340, whatever, 345, 348.

  

[@1:34:18](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5658.41) - **David Nocella**

Okay. 340's time, yeah. I'll send that over to you guys today. A lot of power.

  

[@1:34:26](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5666.23) - **Aaron Oldham**

And we can get better at aggregating that data for you guys to access it as Dave and I map site selection a little better.

And that way we have a shared data set that we all work on. Yep.

  

[@1:34:42](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5682.37) - **David Nocella**

Well, this has been great, guys. Appreciate you going over here 30 minutes or so and walking us through it.

Looks like everything's really coming together and kind of wrapping things up. Kind of just real quick, just timeline in your minds when you'll be done done.

What are your thoughts? What? What? What? There. The goal for me was in the next week.

  

[@1:35:07](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5707.58) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

That's perfect. Okay.

  

[@1:35:09](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5709.94) - **David Nocella**

I don't know, Erik, have you got any other thoughts, but that's what I've been tracking.

  

[@1:35:12](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5712.38) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

No, I think we've done 90 to 95% of the work.

Now it's down to, you know, we do have to make some changes to the building layout and we do have to deliver renderings.

Um, I'd like to be able to deliver some narrative to them for their presentation. So if we can get a copy of something that they presented before, so we hit, can we hit this, the highlights, um, that would be helpful, but I don't think that's unreasonable at all, depending on Julia's schedule.

Cause she's the one doing all the changes to the architectural design and guys, these are not ready for construction.

You know, that this is, this is just, this is a thin coat of paint in a pretty building, right?

Um, the things that, the things that could change, uh, is, you know, the engineer might get into, well, we're going to need bigger mechanical balance.

So now the building is going to have to change a little bit, but there's a, there's a, we'll get you to that 90% point, at least from a

building perspective. Perfect. Or 60 or whatever the right number is. No, I think this is great. So are we giving you value that is exceeding your expectations so far?

Yeah, I would say so.

know, honestly, I was just thinking during this call, you know, at the time when we were engaging with you guys, we were also talking to another architecture firm here in town.

And I was just thinking to myself during the call, like, they would have not gone into this much detail.

They would have given us a building. And that's about it.

  

[@1:36:39](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5799.39) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Well, thank you for that. And I hope you're willing to hope you're willing if we if we continue to do that and get you what you want, maybe you'll be willing to put that in writing from put on our website.

Absolutely. Happy to happy to write a review. Our mission is to safeguard and accelerate critical infrastructure while leaving value that it extends beyond our engagement.

So that's that's what we strive for. So thank you. Thank Yeah, absolutely.

  

[@1:37:06](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5826.14) - **David Nocella**

All right, guys. Well, I'll send you some stuff on the substations and voltages today. But otherwise, looking forward to seeing what you have to share next week.

Do we have a meeting already on the calendar for next week? I think it's either Wednesday or Thursday. Wednesday morning.

It should work for us. And, guys, I'll be in Georgia.

  

[@1:37:28](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5848.36) - **Erik Stockglausner**

So depending on the time zone difference, I should be able to join. It just kind of depends. Is it 1030 Central?

So you should be, yeah. I'll make sure that Benton has everything he needs in case I can't get a connection in Russia.

  

[@1:37:41](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5861.08) - **David Nocella**

1030 Central? I'm showing 830 Mountain. So that would be 930 Central. Either way, we're flexible next week. Daylight savings time happens.

Oh, I guess you should.

  

[@1:37:51](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5871.36) - **Erik Stockglausner**

This weekend. Yeah, this weekend is daylight savings time.

  

[@1:37:54](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5874.92) - **David Nocella**

Does Mountain not switch? No, we do go back an hour or forward an hour. Yeah, so… But we're flexible next week, if we need to move that around, Erik.

  

[@1:38:10](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5890.46) - **Walker Willis**

Erik, not U.S. Georgia. Erik no, Siblici.

  

[@1:38:16](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5896.46) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Erik Yeah, no, I know.

  

[@1:38:18](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5898.22) - **Walker Willis**

Erik For vacation or for work?

  

[@1:38:21](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5901.0) - **Erik Stockglausner**

we've got a project out there that's, let's just say they're not taking the same approach you guys are, they're doing it kind of backwards, but we're doing our best.

Erik know, we want to deliver an award-winning data center in the country of Georgia, but we're still grappling with some challenges around what the technical capabilities of the team that we're working with, and it's like, guys, we really need the basis of design from the critical infrastructure before we start laying out the data halls, because that's all going to change more than likely.

  

[@1:38:54](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5934.06) - **David Nocella**

Erik think this whole time we've been engaged with you, you've been in Europe, isn't that right? Erik No, no, I'm in the U.S.

Stockglaus, I've been in the U.S.

  

[@1:39:00](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5940.7) - **Erik Stockglausner**

for a month, I'm heading to Europe. I Saturday, so I've got like a 30-hour travel day to get there.

leave on Saturday and arrive on Monday, so it's not going to be a lot of fun. Yeah, that is brutal.

  

[@1:39:14](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5954.41) - **David Nocella**

Download a good show and enjoy it.

  

[@1:39:17](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5957.49) - **Erik Stockglausner**

I think with the way my work schedule's been lately, I'm probably going to sleep the majority.

  

[@1:39:24](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5964.19) - **Aaron Oldham**

Well, at least wear a good Halloween costume, Eric.

  

[@1:39:28](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5968.71) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yeah, my wife wouldn't let me leave until the day after Halloween because we always have a bunch of kids come by the house and she wanted me to be here for that, so.

That's nice.

  

[@1:39:37](https://fathom.video/share/kjaR6CCcPw2CPks4sgGCsJLaFcw2EHTN?timestamp=5977.25) - **David Nocella**

Okay. All right. Thanks, everyone. Really appreciate it.
