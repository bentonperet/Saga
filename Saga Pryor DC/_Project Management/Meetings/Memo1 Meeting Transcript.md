From there to look at certain things and I can send you guys documents and stuff to look at. So we've been really digging in.

And I think we really want to start around the discussion about power and kind of like how you guys were thinking about that.

So I know, Walker, I think you had a chance to meet with Mohammed and you guys covered some stuff.

So what we've done is we've pulled together, as I said, that feasibility memo and then a decision tracker. So it's basically 50 something decisions and kind of call outs.

And yeah, we can go through that. So like start with kind of a decision tracker overview and we'll go into the specific tracker and we can kind of get through the various levels and recategorize some things, ask some questions.

And then as we have time, we can go through the feasibility memo or set up some, you know, tables, some meetings if we want to go deeper into some of the conversations.

Ben, give me a second to grab my notebook.

  

[@1:00](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=60.032) - **Erik Stockglausner**

I'll right back.

  

[@1:01](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=61.212) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Okay. So I'll share. It's probably easier. I'm going to start sharing. You guys have a screen up there where you can see stuff?

Yeah. All right. Let's be easier here. I'll just share this window, this whole thing. I'm going to jump around a lot.

So, yeah, we've got Decision Tracker. Can you get this? Yeah.

  

[@1:27](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=87.492) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Thank you, guys.

  

[@1:30](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=90.072) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

You bet. I'm still old-fashioned.

  

[@1:39](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=99.692) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Keep going.

  

[@1:42](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=102.152) - **David Nocella**

Yeah. That guy. It kind of helps. Are you able to maybe just a little bit, Benton? Say that again?

  

[@1:52](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=112.652) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Make it bigger? Yeah. Yeah. If could just zoom in a little bit more.

  

[@1:56](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=116.852) - **David Nocella**

More?

  

[@1:58](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=118.052) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yeah. Let's zoom in a little bit more. Let's about? They've It's What

  

[@2:09](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=129.164) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

So that's that. Feasibility memo, plenty of stuff you can go to there. I have two of these open, which ones?

V2.

  

[@2:21](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=141.644) - **David Nocella**

Just curious, your feasibility memo, how long is that currently, length-wise? A couple pages? It's long.

  

[@2:33](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=153.024) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Call it 20 pages. There's two versions in here that I was kind of making some updates to. So the first half of it, basically there's two exact duplicates, so call it 20 pages.

There was a couple of merging issues with formatting a set that I was just cleaning up that I didn't have time to finish.

But no big deal. And then we can start right here. So decision tracker, quick reference. I think the first thing you want to start with, and Stock, jump in whenever you want, but like the power and kind of what you guys are planning with how to go about using that power is a big discussion point for us because I don't think that, you know, based on early analysis, the amount of solar and battery that you have is going to power a data center in its entirety, given cloudy days and seasonality and all that stuff.

And so I think that the alternate power sources outside of solar and the best battery systems, it's been a really important, you know, portion of the discussion.

We let Aaron in. And so I didn't know if you guys had any specific analysis or thought process on what you were doing there, because we have a lot of potential ideas.

But the first thing was just the utility interconnection. And you'd mentioned when we talked before that it. It might be a couple of years out, and I didn't know to like what degree have you actually looked at utility interconnection and like what do you know about that currently?

Yeah, I'll take this one.

  

[@4:12](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=252.748) - **David Nocella**

So we have, first of all, we've done our own internal like analysis, we've got some software to kind of just look at like interconnection capacity and availability in the area.

And so that data, we have another consultant that is working on that full scope of like interconnection capacity, availability, the price of the SUV market at the nodes down there, kind of pulling together a energy analysis for us.

So, you know, I'm saying that kind of generically, there's a lot of parts to it, because they're going to include some of the, like, I don't know.

You know, 12 by 24 or, you know, 24 by 365, like modeling of power usage and then also power production from our solar battery storage and then looking at the grid in their connection for us.

And so, okay, we're trying to, we are, was that this, was that this net load analysis? Yeah, yeah, that's the one that's the notes that Camelot is doing for us that Walker's talking about, which we're expecting.

By the end of this month.

  

[@5:32](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=332.32) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Okay, gotcha. Okay. Do you guys know, have you looked into demand response?

  

[@5:37](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=337.18) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Is that part of your strategy there? You don't know if that's going to be part of your strategy or?

  

[@5:41](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=341.2) - **David Nocella**

Oh, we haven't looked into that as part of the strategy, strategy yet. I know that SPP market has demand response programs, but that hasn't been a focus because, you know, I guess it can be that, you know, I'm talking about a lot of it, but it makes sense if we're going to be dynamic in year.

you know, one and two to manage our load. Is there a way to like value that in later years?

Yeah. It's an added layer that I don't know that we want to get into yet. Okay. Okay.

  

[@6:14](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=374.992) - **Erik Stockglausner**

The reason I asked that question is because I've, I've, I guess, done a little research to learn that there, there was a demand response program in Oklahoma, even though it's a regulated market, and that, um, I didn't know if you wanted to plan for that ahead of time.

You know, we looked at a couple of different scenarios that may or may not be interesting to you, but there's, um, potentially a way to leverage the, the BES system as a UPS and avoid needing a UPS in the building designed a little bit differently, but if you create, for lack of a better term, microgrid and supplement it, you're not going to be able to do it all at solar.

probably have to put turbine and reset compressors in there as well. Right. Um, but if you, if you're able to do that and design it ahead of time, it gives you the flexibility to take advantage of that one, when I was

At Aligned Energy, the electrical utility paid for all of that batteries and generators, basically everything that went in the equipment yard, including the UPSs that were kind of a, I guess, an industrial grade UPS.

I don't think we called them VESSs back then. I'm not sure. I'm not an expert by any stretch, but I know it was a very lucrative deal for Aligned.

Essentially, I think the utility paid for most, if not all, of the equipment. Yeah. So I don't know if that's something that you are entertaining or thinking about, but it might be a way to drive getting some of the equipment, you know, covered ahead of time and you, you know, it's not all going to be green power, obviously, we don't have enough green power to it, but I think the thing that we're trying to understand is what is the market interest in a, in a facility that, you know, might have to shed load and if they're not going to shed load, what do they get in exchange for For shedding load.

But that's a very fundamental. Question of ours, because it impacts the overall design. You might not need a UPS, you might not need generators, or you might need less generators for the data center design.

it takes me to my next question, which is, are you underwriting these two deals separately? Is the solar installation a separate investment analysis than the data center analysis?

Because if it is, go ahead.

  

[@8:21](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=501.896) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

It's like 10 things. No, no, no, just want to like, like, pause for a sec. Because the first, I just want to get their reaction to that first part, like, especially like using the best as your UPS, or just having like a smaller system, UPS system to condition the power, and be able to save some significant funding there.

think that was a really key call out. We love that, right?

  

[@8:47](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=527.996) - **David Nocella**

I absolutely love it. And why wouldn't, right, if we have more capacity with the battery storage, they're to operate on the millisecond, you know, basis versus the UPS system.

You know, let's say it will operate very quickly, but that seems like redundancy that we'd love to shave out, right?

And as we try and create a project, you know, this unique project here, that's the type of efficiency that we're going to need to find in order to justify the smaller size and all the other things we're trying to pull together here.

I guess my, you know, there's multiple levels of, like, comfort here around, like, you know, building what is known versus building something new.

I feel like we want to be, like, kind of halfway under, the building needs to be halfway under what is known, like, typical, accepted by the industry, like, we'll go for that, we'll pay you your rates to lease it.

And then maybe less than half of it in the unknown area, you know, of, like, doing something new in the market.

I'd say probably more, like, I'm a little bit spitballing here, you know, again, just, I... If the UPS feels like of those, to me, feels like one of those that is like, that's pretty easy.

  

[@10:07](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=607.64) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

It's just electrical and controls.

  

[@10:09](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=609.54) - **David Nocella**

You know, that's a known thing. We can get people to accept that as a, you know, easy replacement. That feels good.

That feels good to me. And I would love to have that kind of new approach with using the battery storage as our UPS.

And then if we can shave costs for, you know, square footage of the building and, you know, all the additional ATS, bus bars and everything you need, then all the batteries need to be maintained every, you know, year because there's lot of batteries or whatever you're using in a typical UPS.

That's all good. And I guess I'll stop there for a second. That kind of answers that question. Totally. Yeah, we did some analysis on that.

  

[@10:56](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=656.54) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

And I think that it looked like the best solution was to have some UPSs kind Yeah. Not your full amount, but just like a smaller amount.

It gives you like five minutes or something like that just to clear, smooth everything out. But there's some significant savings in that because you'll save a few million bucks in UPS systems.

And I think that you could still go and if you wanted the uptime certificate or whatever, you could still get that through with them depending on all the details.

I guess before we go, sorry, sorry.

  

[@11:30](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=690.012) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Let me finish that concept just for a second. You can still get, you know, concurrent maintainability. The VES system will have to be designed a little bit differently, like you said.

If you deploy your capital incrementally and you build this out in a modular way, you can create an environment that is completely backed up by the VES system.

And if another client wants to move in and wants to put in more traditional UPSs and generators, you can certainly accommodate them.

There's nothing to prevent you from doing that. It just increases your losses and it's added equipment. You probably don't need, but if they're willing to pay.

Bye. Bye. I'd say that it's worth at least looking into, but yeah, I think that's just a point we wanted to try to figure out if we think you maybe did something your consultant can look into and look into the demand response, because if you can get those incentives and get some of it paid for, it stands to save you significant amount of dollars on the infrastructure for the data center.

Back to my other question though, are you going to evaluate these two separately or as a combined unit? Because if it's separate, then it's easy to go and get a market rate on what a cap rate will be if you eventually want to sell the rent or sell it off to a fund or whatever at some point in time and capitalize on it.

  

[@12:43](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=763.924) - **David Nocella**

And that's where I, you know, currently we're evaluating like the solar and battery separate from the data center because that does get out like, that's a power gen asset.

In theory, we could like, you know, parcel up the land. not rate on, there, And then sell that. And that could be energy company number one, managing that, selling the power to data center number two owner there.

So that's how it's split up. Obviously, how this ultimately plays out, it's the writing of the story, so. Totally.

  

[@13:18](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=798.136) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

And you could present the options to whoever your investor is. I think that's an important thing. Like, hey, like, here's option one.

We keep these in two, you know, two totally different buckets. And you have your best that lives over there.

And then you have your UPSs that live over here with the, you know, the fully functional data center that you could sell off.

And then you just sell the power. And it's probably an option three, two, which is a hybrid bit somehow for that structure as well.

There's always a way. but, yeah.

  

[@13:45](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=825.456) - **Aaron Oldham**

Doing the power dance. Like, so to me, if we can bring really the addressable market as wide as possible, the co-location space.

Sok, have you seen the co-location space? Yeah. Closer and closer and closer to PUE margins that the hyperscalers are succeeding at?

  

[@14:06](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=846.328) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yeah, they're doing that a couple different ways. They're doing it through, you know, if you close couple the heat and the heat rejection, that's where you get your most efficient heat removal, right?

So rear door heat exchangers are a great solution for that. Obviously, directed chip is a great solution for that, but directed chip is not going to work for everybody.

It's going to have to be a very special client, but rear door heat exchangers are pretty much a really good way to allow the customer to have the environment that they want without, you know, I'll tell you a quick horror story.

When I was selling a big piece of NTT's data center to Oracle, they had set the first customer had the SLA for the space, and it was a big shared space.

They used fan balls, so they couldn't modulate the environmental controls of just their little environment. So Oracle was bound to that SLA, which was a very strict cold temperature SLA.

They wanted to increase the temperature to save energy. Oh, yeah. And they couldn't because we had a little colo client there that had already been locked into a specific SLA.

So this avoids getting into that scenario, too.

  

[@15:09](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=909.7) - **David Nocella**

So a question for you guys, does this alternative way of thinking about things, will that potentially change our BES design?

Do we need to account for more batteries?

  

[@15:23](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=923.04) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yeah, you have to make it concurrently maintainable. And I think in order for the market to accept it, we've done some back of the napkin mathematics on it.

And, you know, it is slightly more expensive than just a traditional BES and solar combined. Not to mention, if you're going to add the generation in there to charge the batteries when there's not enough solar, that's going to add.

That's why it's asked about the demand response, because some of that might be covered under demand response. And then there's an offset because you're going to probably save three to four million dollars, maybe five million dollars in the total life of the UPS and battery replacements for the for the for the data center itself.

So I guess guess what.

  

[@16:00](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=960.512) - **David Nocella**

We might need from our end for the battery and solar and site design as a whole is some recommendations on site, like total megawatts that we should be thinking about as far as capacity for all the batteries.

If you could tell us that, Walker can update our design to account for the added batteries. And then also on the flip side of that, if you could also maybe estimate how much savings on a CapEx side the building itself would save and any additional costs that we may need to incorporate into our batteries to account for it acting as like a UPS system.

We can put all that into our model.

  

[@16:46](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1006.11) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yeah, I can share the back of the napkin map that we've done and then you can share it with your consultant.

And obviously it would need to get pressure tested by an engineer, Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's exactly. We've started that.

  

[@16:58](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1018.83) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

I mean, I have that. I'm making. I'll you. don't think it's ready fully yet, but that's where the study scope was really interesting to me.

I don't know if maybe if you can send me this SOW or the scope, not the full SOW, but just the scope portion of what you're expecting back from the utility interconnection study slash load study that they're doing, because we can definitely help with some of that and spend a little bit of engineering time on it if you want.

I just don't want to overlap with something you've already engaged.

  

[@17:29](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1049.36) - **David Nocella**

Yeah, no, I'm happy to share that with you. And if you want, we're meeting with that consultant tomorrow afternoon at 4pm Eastern.

And I can I can invite you to that call and you can ask any questions if that'd be helpful.

Maybe.

  

[@17:47](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1067.02) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah, I think first off, just understanding what they're doing. That way we don't step on any toes. Yeah, and then I would really want probably Mohammed on that.

That's kind of a late for him. Yeah. Well. Let me know.

  

[@18:01](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1081.52) - **David Nocella**

I'll send you some information after this call. And then as an action item, potentially for us, the demand response, maybe that's a revenue stream that we need to model that we have.

We're looking to, yeah. I'm somewhat familiar with it. And so I could potentially dig into that. Okay. Totally.

  

[@18:22](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1102.32) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah.

  

[@18:22](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1102.92) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Like I have a, I have a potential prospect for your building. They're, you know, probably if they're not investment grade rated, they're very close to being investment grade rated.

And, you know, they've struggled to find polo capacity. They have a need potential to be next to GCP. So, but they want to move into the space incrementally if they were to take it and they want to kind of have a say in how it's designed.

Mm-hmm. This particular client, I can't give you too much detail because we're still under NDA and I got to.

No, that's okay.

  

[@18:53](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1133.76) - **David Nocella**

I think at this point we're just modeling, you know, big picture. Yeah.

  

[@18:58](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1138.08) - **Erik Stockglausner**

But they're, they would probably want to do. So power pass-through model, where I think in your investment analysis, you've got an all-in rate, and I didn't know if there was a reason for that as well, if that was just based on retail COLO assumption, or if you were open to a power pass-through model.

  

[@19:17](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1157.45) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Does that make sense? Yeah, I think we're open to it, right?

  

[@19:20](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1160.93) - **David Nocella**

Our initial model was all-in, because that was initial, right? That was the first take on this. And so if we're able to kind of model both options and see if there's a revenue gain for a pass-through or easier to market for kind of our client base, who's going to be the tenants, like, yeah, we're open to that.

I do always want to keep in mind, it's like, you know, don't want get too complex too soon, right?

And so- think it's actually simpler. Do you be simpler to kind of model- Will the revenue that way as a power pass-through versus kind of the all-in?

  

[@20:06](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1206.44) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

You know, based on Stock and I are talking quite a bit about it. We think the IRR is going to go out.

We haven't done like a full analysis of it, but I think you're going to, you're going to get, you know, 15 to 19% IRR versus a 12%.

And it seems to be a lot more standard on like how people want to buy, what the customers want to buy.

It doesn't prevent you from having a retail model.

  

[@20:27](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1227.6) - **Erik Stockglausner**

You can still do an all-in power solution for your retail customers. But when you, if you get an enterprise customer that wants to come in and say they want to take two megawatts today and grow to five megawatts over three years.

You know, they're willing to lease the shell portion of the building from you for some period of time until they decide they're ready to take it.

And if they don't take it by that determination of that, you know, triple net rent scenario, then you market it and build it out and sell it to whoever you want to.

But they're going to want to do, most enterprise clients are going to take a meg or more, are to want to do power pass-through.

They don't want to, they don't want to pay. For power, even if they're not using it.

  

[@21:03](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1263.61) - **David Nocella**

Okay, so you could do both. Both have been done.

  

[@21:06](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1266.25) - **Erik Stockglausner**

It's, it's, it's not a problem. You can carve out a one megawatt pod for just retail colo, buy the rack, buy the rack unit, um, and charge it how you want, uh, for an all-in price.

So then you can have a separate model for what we call a wholesale client that wants to take, you know, large chunk.

Mm-hmm.

  

[@21:23](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1283.43) - **David Nocella**

Okay. Well, I mean, it seems like a bit of adjustment on our side, but I mean, um, it doesn't seem particularly complex.

And so, um, yeah, fine with either way. Obviously, I'm trying to read, are you gonna pass these notes on, Benton, Benton?

Yeah, I'll pass this on and then, and then I'll pass the, the memo.

  

[@21:43](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1303.85) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

We have a lot more data in like each of these extra sections around all that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

  

[@21:50](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1310.01) - **David Nocella**

We may take this back to our consultant that, that provided insight on them on our revenue model. So yeah, if you could have that as an action item.

  

[@22:17](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1337.78) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

So you guys don't have an ETA on grid power delivery, right?

  

[@22:22](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1342.1) - **Erik Stockglausner**

It's still kind of up in the air? Yeah, definitely still up in the air.

  

[@22:27](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1347.26) - **David Nocella**

We, I mean, admittedly, we haven't even applied yet, right? We're trying to do the diligence here before we get the application in and then get rolling.

I know in SPP, didn't they have the large load? Good. Like the new process. Process update. I think it was a couple months ago.

They're trying to streamline that and make it faster for large load interconnection. But yeah, admittedly, we haven't started that process yet.

We expect it to be. Yeah, a couple of years like it is anywhere. I think in our model right now, we have development going over the course of like the next two years.

And then the facility comes online in like late 27, early 28. And then we've modeled an occupancy rate that kind of climbs over the first two or three years, starting out like, I want to say 50% occupancy, maybe 70% and kind of clipping up year over year.

And we've assumed that initial two or three year timeframe, we would have a smaller than the total load of the facility needed.

So we would be able to provide solar and battery power primarily as the energy source. And then by year two or three, we have grid power after the facility has been operating.

  

[@23:58](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1438.32) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah. Yeah. Makes sense.

  

[@24:03](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1443.77) - **David Nocella**

But the earlier the better on the utility stuff. Yeah, so like those first couple years that we're trying to be behind, you know, off-grid, we'll need to know from you guys, like, you know, do we have enough solar?

Do we have enough batteries? Do we need to, you know, fit in more where we can? Or do we need to also incorporate, you know, a gas turbine or something with the facility to make sure that we have the redundancy we need?

  

[@24:35](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1475.75) - **Erik Stockglausner**

That's exactly the analysis that we did when we were talking about trying to evaluate. Okay. Just hate to buy UPSs twice.

Yeah. You don't need to, and you get the whole, the whole building's backed up on UPS now. So you don't have to worry about separate UPS system for the mechanical loads.

If, when you do a transfer, all that stuff's covered. But it does involve, you know, some supplemental generation. Yeah.

All right. It's just creating a microgrid, basically. Your solar plant becomes a microgrid.

  

[@25:09](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1509.42) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yep, we can do that. Next thing, natural gas. I don't know. I saw somewhere there's a natural gas service that's there.

I don't know if that was in your basis of design or if it was somewhere else, but I wanted to confirm what natural gas is going on there, like if you guys know.

  

[@25:27](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1527.72) - **David Nocella**

I think there's a natural gas line right behind the property. What would be the best way to show that?

Yeah. Maybe this is, instead of trying to recreate it on the meeting here, we have to go over a weekend.

Yeah, I'll write that down as an action. I'll send you a more detail where we saw that natural gas line, but it's right at the, I believe it's right at the south, southwest corner of the property.

Add to that, find out who the provider is. Yeah, we may be able to tell you. And then also is, we're doing an ALTA survey next week on site, and that'll have all the utilities at least on site.

  

[@26:15](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1575.11) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah. Is, uh, natural gas as well?

  

[@26:19](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1579.73) - **David Nocella**

Mmm, I don't know if that. We should check.

  

[@26:24](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1584.97) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Also, like with those natural gas lines, just understanding, like, is it intermittent? Is it, like, guaranteed to have the pressure you need?

You know, because that can really change depending on market situations and what's going on in that area. So, like, is it a viable turbine running natural gas line or not, really, is the question, or generators, you know what mean?

Hey, guys, I hope it's not too late to join.

  

[@26:51](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1611.65) - **Muhammed Kurt**

Not at all. Mahmoud, welcome.

  

[@26:54](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1614.97) - **David Nocella**

Yeah, I'm sure we can find out the entity that owns it. We may have to call them to find out.

Some of the more details about the line, though. Yeah, we can do an action on that.

  

[@27:07](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1627.24) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Cool. Which kind of goes to the same area of generator strategy, you know, whether turbine, natural gas, diesel, and then kind of- Are you leaning towards one of those options for the, you know, added redundancy?

  

[@27:26](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1646.94) - **Erik Stockglausner**

It just depends on what direction you decide to go with the microgrid. If you decide to go with the microgrid option, think turbine's probably going to be a better solution.

You could always, customer could always say, hey, we're just not completely comfortable with that. We want our own two and a half meg gen.

And then you go, okay, sure. You know, if something doesn't work, you've got your own generator. And that could be a two and a half meg reset, you know, or a 38.75 or whatever.

It doesn't necessarily matter as long as it fits their load. Okay.

  

[@27:55](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1675.76) - **David Nocella**

I guess, when do you need to know the answer to that to be able to, you know, stay on track with

The design?

  

[@28:02](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1682.04) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Well, the building design, I think we can get you, you know, the design based on, you know, what you have today.

I just wanted to make sure that we bring these things to your attention. We can give you a design that says, here's traditional design with UPS.

Here's a design without UPS. And with assuming you have a microgrid with natural gas generation, and then, you know, model those two.

And then that way you can take, and we can try to give you, you know, some reasonable assumptions around the cost of each.

then you could take that to the investors. But I think the real question is, is demand response available? What kind of incentive could you get if it was?

Yeah. Okay.

  

[@28:40](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1720.14) - **David Nocella**

Well, we'll try to dig into that this week and get some more feedback to you guys.

  

[@28:46](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1726.16) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

All right. I think that's possible.

  

[@28:48](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1728.74) - **David Nocella**

Yeah, think so. Yeah. The Amazon.

  

[@28:53](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1733.64) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Perfect. All right. Alright, let's jump over to this guy, Decision Log. There's a few things I wanted to run through.

So we kind of covered a lot of this, I think, microgrid, utilities, interconnection, natural gas service. So I think that one's good.

Oh, on the substation capacity, how did you guys come up with that one, the transformer capacity?

  

[@29:35](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1775.07) - **David Nocella**

Did we give you that already? I think it was in the basis of design, I believe.

  

[@29:41](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1781.89) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

I'm not 100% sure. Or if you're still working on it, we can just put it as like something that you guys are working on.

But it seemed like it might be a snitch low, but that was just, we don't know. You know, that was like the first question though.

  

[@29:55](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1795.55) - **David Nocella**

If it was on the basis of design, it was, it was what the financial consultant. Let's start. see. Let's

  

[@30:02](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1802.32) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

So we should just double check that.

  

[@30:04](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1804.28) - **David Nocella**

Okay, I can double check his work there.

  

[@30:08](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1808.32) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Cool. Demand response we talked about. On the site and building, you guys have raised floor, and we think we can do away with that, save a little bit of money and make things a little easier.

We can all be supported off the ground, a little bit more modern.

  

[@30:31](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1831.8) - **Aaron Oldham**

Yeah, especially as we pursue the direct pitch of cooling, raised floor can be done after the fact if the client really, really, really, really wants it.

  

[@30:44](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1844.2) - **David Nocella**

Yeah, we were just trying to think ahead there, you know, with the liquid cooling, if raised floor is going to be needed, you know, down the road, might as well do it now.

  

[@30:55](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1855.06) - **Aaron Oldham**

The liquid cooling distribution systems are above the rack. Okay. Okay. Do Okay.

  

[@31:00](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1860.68) - **David Nocella**

Thank you. Okay. We have both, but it's like, we don't see raised floor a lot in modern data centers.

  

[@31:05](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1865.53) - **Erik Stockglausner**

It's just like an added cost and an added level of complexity. Maintenance costs go up because you got to get under the floor and like the risk analysis data says that it's not worth the risk.

  

[@31:17](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1877.59) - **David Nocella**

yeah, OK, well, we can take that back and refine our capex for the building. Maybe drop some costs there if you.

Yeah, we have that in the thought process.

  

[@31:27](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1887.55) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

So you're all good to remove that one. OK.

  

[@31:33](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1893.85) - **David Nocella**

Let's see.

  

[@31:36](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1896.43) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

We should have a little decision. This is like proceed without raised floor. Do you want to hold on to it?

that's fine. That's fine.

  

[@31:44](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1904.19) - **David Nocella**

Just make a note for me to tell the guy that did the financial capex. OK. We'll want to incorporate that into our model that we're taking.

mentioned.

  

[@31:58](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1918.09) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

doubt. vielen almost answer in that. Okay. And you, when That's detail. Don't Thank Yeah. I can't type. I think these are both the same issue, actually.

Race for structural slab loading. Oh, this is different. Yeah. Yeah. It's just engineering.

  

[@32:25](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1945.42) - **Erik Stockglausner**

That's an engineering make validate the slab.

  

[@32:29](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1949.44) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah. I had that. And there's also the soil study will tell us if there's anything quirky in there that wouldn't permit certain structural slabs, like if you need piers or something, but I don't think there would be.

Yeah.

  

[@32:44](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1964.14) - **David Nocella**

If we're removing the raised floor, there shouldn't be any foundation loading concerns, right?

  

[@32:51](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1971.7) - **Erik Stockglausner**

No, you just want to make sure that you've got a floor, a floor load that will accommodate the, if you want to put liquid chip in there, those are the racks that get really heavy.

Okay.

  

[@33:00](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1980.96) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Okay.

  

[@33:01](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1981.06) - **David Nocella**

Yeah, we did get the preliminary geotech analysis, the desktop level analysis back last week. I'll put that in the Dropbox for you, and let us know if anything from that report stands out.

Right on.

  

[@33:16](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=1996.82) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah, and so the second part of this is that tornado resistance in this area is really important and having things like a, I forget which stock you were mentioning, the roof type that they might want to go with.

Yeah, it's a little bit more expensive, but also a little heavier.

  

[@33:31](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=2011.32) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Now, when I was at Digital Realty, we had a data center in Houston, and obviously hurricanes and flooding were the big concern, but tornadoes that get spun up through hurricanes were also a concern.

So they built a factory mutual standard. It's called an FMI-135 or 1-135, and it's tied to property and casualty insurance.

But that's something that we've determined or we determined back then was the we didn't want to go much over that because the expense didn't offset the risk.

And that was the. good Thank The we got from the FM Global people was FM, you know, I-135 is kind of the sweet spot if you're going to design for tornado resistance or some sort of uplift, that's the uplift pressure.

I learned that the tornadoes don't blow the roofs off, they actually, the roofs get sucked off because of the negative pressure, which is interesting.

But it's just tied to the fasteners that are on the roof and the type of construction, sometimes they're weighted or sometimes they're structural roof.

But the other thing I thought might be a good, we had a data center on Marsh Lane in Dallas that had a tornado shelter.

And for your operations team, if a tornado comes, they're going to be there. You'd like for them to be safe if the tornado gets in the area, you want them to be able to go down from within the facility and get to a sheltered area.

So that's a consideration for you to think about. It's at a cost, but I think it's one of those things that people are going to consider your location.

They're going to want to have some level of protection for their people.

  

[@34:56](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=2096.09) - **David Nocella**

Yeah, no, it's a good point and something that. We really haven't talked a whole lot about, but one thing that does come to mind when you're talking about all those things is we are having a catastrophic insurance analysis done for modeling our insurance rates, and if there's anything incorporated into the building envelope that would mitigate potential damage during an event like this, let us know so we can let our insurance advisor know, because they may model that.

Specifically and could incorporate like a lower rate, potentially. Yeah. I know they're doing that with our solar array because we're implementing like STO technology if a hailstorm comes through.

So, Erik, if you could, or Muhammed or anyone, send me any details that you're specifically incorporating into the architecture of the building to mitigate any kind of

You know, storm risk. I'd like to tell that to our insurance advisor. And Stockglaus, with that being like Houston and that standard, I haven't heard of the FMI like 135, but that's probably kind of based on like the ASE wind map levels, right?

And so, I mean, I'm just curious, and I'm holding up on my phone, you know, Houston has obviously the hurricane wind map levels that are much higher risk than Tulsa, where our like max wind speed's going to be, you know, 100 miles an hour instead of, you know, or whatever it is.

Houston. I'd be curious to look into that, what you're talking about here, which I'm not familiar with it. Yeah, I'll try to get you some more sources, cite some sources for you.

  

[@37:14](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=2234.06) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Okay, that'd be awesome.

  

[@37:18](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=2238.76) - **David Nocella**

Are you worried about shelter? No, no, I'm just like, I kind of want to tie this together to what I'm familiar with on the energy side and like the ASCE, like wind mapping being kind of the leading point of reference.

And then like building your solar, because the same thing with solar, like that uplift pressure on the panels is like the structurally the leading factor, right?

It is not the weight of the panels or anything, it's actually the uplift that kind of like dictates how big your piles are, how deep they are, the steel sizing, all that stuff.

So there's probably some good overlap there between the two. It's mostly for my education, right on.

  

[@38:11](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=2291.42) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Should we talk procurement a little bit? Sure. So, obviously, you guys know there's lead times on all this stuff.

I didn't know if you had any sort of connections with industry, whether it's Schneider or others, or kind of like a line of sight into ordering and kind of what that would take.

I guess with the time that you're kind of mentioning and the ramped approach, we could probably mitigate a lot of that, but I didn't know if you guys like how you typically run procurement and kind of think about a long, long pull in the tent and kind of things like that.

You guys are managing to that?

  

[@38:50](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=2330.0) - **David Nocella**

Transformers, switch gear, know, all those stuff, long lead items. We are, you know, in the power industry, pretty well connected with GE Pro-Life, Virginia Trans.

Transformers, Transformer, you know, Hitachi, ABB Transformers, all those folks. We haven't gotten a quote on this yet, but we can get one.

I'm reaching out currently for one of our other projects for a much larger Transformer, a Virginia Transformer, so we can get a sense of what that lead times would look like.

Okay, for all this stuff too. Yeah, and then I feel like Generac, we should talk to them a little bit about generators.

Yeah, you know, I think you guys mentioned you're kind of leaning towards a gas turbine, but I think those lead times I've heard are like five years.

And we do have some connections with Generac where maybe, you know, maybe we went with a diesel generator and a diesel tank outside the building.

You know, lead time would be much, much better.

  

[@40:02](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=2402.32) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yeah, let me look into that, too, because I had a guy I just talked to recently that said that they had a bunch of turbines that lead times were not that bad, but I'll double check on that.

Re-sips are obviously an optional solution. It's just going to be more costly. They're not as efficient. So the financial analysis will look different in terms of what the average weighted cost of power is going to be when you're using that microgrid strategy.

But it may still be worth it if there's incentives there for demand response. Okay.

  

[@40:37](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=2437.54) - **David Nocella**

Oh, sorry. Go ahead, David. I was going to just mention that we're probably not going to get too into the weeds with lead times at this point.

I do know that, you know, there are certain equipment that are a few years out right now, high voltage breakers and transformers and stuff, but we're probably not going to get too bogged down with getting into the details of that just quite yet.

Yeah. I agree with you.

  

[@41:03](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=2463.01) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

I think it's really just where there are total problems. If it's five years to get a turbine, then that's a problem.

  

[@41:13](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=2473.03) - **David Nocella**

We would, I think, appreciate some introductions. If you guys have anybody on the air pool chiller procurement, liquid-to-liquid CDUs.

If you're not familiar, Aaron, you probably have some connections as well, but you have the power equipment pretty well covered, but some of those, if those also have near lead times, that'd be good to know.

Yeah.

  

[@41:38](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=2498.55) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

I think we talked a little bit about the rear door heat exchangers versus the fan walls and the modularity and sort of the ability for clients to use different things.

But I think this is something that we should maybe make the decision on earlier than later. Stock, what do you think?

Like, I think it seems to me based on what I know and what you've kind of mentioned that the rear door heat exchanger is just the better.

  

[@42:03](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=2523.82) - **Erik Stockglausner**

It allows you to deploy the capital incrementally. you build out your data center with your children, Waterloo, and assuming you're not going to, if you're going to build out a spec colo space, you might, you might look at this a little bit differently, but if you're going to think about standardizing on some equipment long term, the rear door heat exchanger is something that you can deploy if and when you need it, just like the CDU.

So you don't necessarily have to buy this equipment until the customer decides that's what they want. You could still build out a spec colo environment with rear door heat exchangers and hook that up to the show Waterloo.

You'll need some base comfort cooling and you'll accommodate that with maybe an air handling unit or something of that nature.

But ultimately, it just gives you the flexibility to deploy capital incrementally instead of doing it all at once and it generally improves your returns.

  

[@42:52](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=2572.38) - **David Nocella**

Does Schneider Electric Line have the fan walls included already? I don't don't

  

[@43:01](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=2581.38) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

I think they were craw-used, I think.

  

[@43:02](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=2582.9) - **Erik Stockglausner**

I think it was craw-used, but I can't remember. I'll have to go back and look again because I got two or three of these we're working on right now, so forgive me if I'm getting mixed up.

  

[@43:10](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=2590.34) - **David Nocella**

Yeah, I'm just thinking if it was something that came, because I don't recall fan walls being something that we, like, asked for, so if that's something that Schneider Electric incorporated into their stock reference design, we're okay with making changes from that stock reference design if you guys recommend it.

So, and again, let us know if this is a design change that you recommend and that we want to go with.

That's great. I just want to, again, tell our financial consultant, maybe there's a CapEx difference there, removing the fan wall and adding the rear door heat exchangers.

  

[@43:49](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=2629.22) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yeah, I think it gives you much more flexibility to go dense. So you can go up to, you know, 25, arguably 30 kilowatts a cabinet, which is going to be a stretch if you're going to use fan wall or even crawl units.

much. right. Thank Especially under race-floor environments. But if you were to build out a one-megawatt retail colo space and you use rear-door heat exchangers, you can kind of deploy those as needed and just tie those into the chilled water loop.

And like I said, you can deploy that capital incrementally as the customer moves in. Yeah, that change sounds good to me.

  

[@44:22](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=2662.59) - **David Nocella**

Yeah, let's go ahead with it.

  

[@44:30](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=2670.69) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

All right. Really, a fun one, really, is that you can use your stormwater pond as a security perimeter, kind of swap positions, and like maybe give it a little bit of a shape.

You could help to keep a truck from driving through anything because you've got a moat.

  

[@44:47](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=2687.45) - **David Nocella**

you use a drawbridge to go with that? Yes.

  

[@44:52](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=2692.99) - **Erik Stockglausner**

You could if you wanted to get that sophisticated, but sometimes people, well, I don't know that. I've seen this yet.

You can leverage that water retention as an area that also serves as a security perimeter. It's usually outside the perimeter fence, but even though you don't want some guy having a heart attack in his big rig and driving through your fence, you know?

  

[@45:19](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=2719.84) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

I guess there's no highway down there, but yeah, it would be more like someone in their ATV or something or the little tank.

I don't really know. I saw this site. Down there in the south, it doesn't seem like there's much of anything.

No.

  

[@45:36](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=2736.24) - **David Nocella**

need this one on here and obviously we can just design around that. Yeah, it's low, but it was a fun thought to build a moat around your castle.

  

[@45:46](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=2746.42) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

That's what I was thinking too. What's next? We got a few more minutes. Mechanical systems. What is this one?

  

[@45:56](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=2756.46) - **Erik Stockglausner**

I think that's another item that you can defer to based on the client demand. If you... If you buy those things in advance, you're assuming that somebody's going to come in that needs that direct-to-check cooling technology, and I don't know that you necessarily need to go that far unless, you know, you have a client that's ready to buy or sign a lease.

Was that something on their financial model you saw, Stock?

  

[@46:21](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=2781.79) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

I don't recall if I saw that in a financial model.

  

[@46:24](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=2784.25) - **Erik Stockglausner**

I just know, I hear them talking about it, and I know that that's something that's being considered, so. Got it.

  

[@46:33](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=2793.97) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Again, Adam, I think we can defer.

  

[@46:37](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=2797.09) - **David Nocella**

I don't really have an opinion other than would it be timed with our occupancy rate model?

  

[@46:46](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=2806.77) - **Erik Stockglausner**

So, it's customer dependent, so it's, you know, investment analysis is only good as your ability to predict how quickly you're going to, that capacity is going to get absorbed, right?

And so, that's why I recommend kind of. . . Doing a combined model that includes retail, colo, and what I call wholesale model, which is a power pass-through, and then look at a direct power pass-through model, exclusive of the retail model, because you never know, the right client might come to you and tell me, we want the whole building, and we'll take it, we just want to take it incrementally, and then it's just a matter of crafting an agreement that doesn't tie it up for too long, because you guys want to market it.

And I've had some experience doing that too. There's some ways you can design the lease in such a way that, you know, if they don't take it in two years or three years or whatever you determine, you can market it to somebody else.

Yeah.

  

[@47:42](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=2862.44) - **David Nocella**

Okay.

  

[@47:48](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=2868.74) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Water and wastewater. Have you guys done any study on that, or have any data about what kind of water usage you can use?

of Mr. Janek.

  

[@47:59](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=2879.68) - **David Nocella**

unless there was some fact… Faxing the Schneider design on usage.

  

[@48:06](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=2886.38) - **Erik Stockglausner**

If you're going to go with any sort of adiabatic, you know, economization, which I think you were looking at in your fluid coolers, not a bad design.

I have to go back and look. There is a chiller that's manufactured by Schneider and some others that has an integrated free cooling coil.

It's not going to be as efficient as your design, but it has the benefit of not requiring any water.

So if water is a business risk or it's a community problem, you know, because you're going to be using essentially potable water to do this, unless they have a gray water source that I'm not aware of, then, you know, it's just something that we have to look into.

The easy button, it's not always the most efficient, is an integrated free cooling coil and an air cooler. And those come as one giant package unit.

  

[@48:55](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=2935.68) - **David Nocella**

You know, we are, the site is located next to a river. I don't think there is... Is a constraint of ours, but that being said, you know, our client is very sustainability focused, so a closed loop system would be preferred in his eyes, so if we could just make that decision now, even if it adds a little bit of capex, if it makes it easier to model our water usage and we can brag about it's a closed loop system and doesn't require, you know, ongoing additional water consumption.

That helps our story. Yeah, we'll look into it.

  

[@49:37](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=2977.17) - **Erik Stockglausner**

I need to double check the, I forget what they call the graphs that tell you how many hours of free cooling you get with each solution.

You'll get more with the design that you have, but it might not be a whole lot more. Yeah. And if it's, I seem to recall the Ozarks or that area being relatively humid, so I don't know exactly how much benefit you'll really.

But let us look at the curves and see what kind of free cooling you could expect from the design that we're talking about.

Okay.

  

[@50:24](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=3024.7) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah. I don't know if this one's on here twice. Let's see if there's anything else that we said here.

Yeah, same thing. Our pricing model we talked about, going to try to, I gathered we're going to do both.

Like look at the options for both and then pass you any information that you could run through your financial consultant.

Sensitivity analysis. What was this one, Stock? Okay.

  

[@50:58](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=3058.56) - **David Nocella**

This was, um,

  

[@51:02](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=3062.63) - **Erik Stockglausner**

I think what we were trying to show is the sensitivity analysis. If we go over, so if we go beyond our contingency in the budget, there's always a chance that there might be, we might be off the mark on costs or costs are going to change.

If this is a year out, we don't know what the chiller is going to cost at that point in time or what the lead times are going to be.

So it might be helpful for us to do or have your financial consultant do some sensitivity analysis on, you know, if you want to get rid really sophisticated, do a Monte Carlo simulation and tell you what your risk might be of your CapEx going over.

Yeah.

  

[@51:39](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=3099.95) - **David Nocella**

Yeah. The sooner we can get any kind of feedback as far as the financial analysis goes, the better because he'll probably need a few weeks to take it all in.

I don't know if that needs to be high until we get more of a big design.

  

[@51:55](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=3115.29) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Sure.

  

[@51:56](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=3116.63) - **David Nocella**

Yeah. Once the, once the design is fully baked, you know, let's send over a list of stuff. But changes, recommendations, things to maybe consider, and we can send it over to him.

I just want to give him at least a few weeks to mull it all over.

  

[@52:14](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=3134.4) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

And so you guys were saying earlier that you were having, like, two separate entities or two separate assets, the solar and the data center.

That's what you're thinking, right? Yeah. Yeah. We can help you with the generator stuff when we get all the other information.

Emissions and air permitting and things like that, is that your environmental study? Like, if you were going to try to run, you know, diesel generators, there's all sorts of sound permitting, like how often you're going to run them, how long you're going to run them, emissions, and all that kind of.

In your calculus for that study?

  

[@53:05](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=3185.88) - **David Nocella**

Yeah, yeah, they, you know, they'll be completing a permitting matrix of recommended or what they think is going to be required from a local, state and federal, you know, standpoint, that'll be included with the environmental assessment.

Cool.

  

[@53:27](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=3207.84) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah, kind of covers the acoustics. We won't go into UPS because we're going have to go top down design that more.

OCP compliance, specific rationale. Oh, yeah, Stock, do you want to ask this question? Maybe they know it on the OCP compliance that was in there.

  

[@53:48](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=3228.72) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yeah, was there a reason you guys wanted to be OCP compliant? Was there something that drove that?

  

[@53:55](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=3235.12) - **David Nocella**

Again, that's probably, that's either from our financial consultant, just from his experience? It's developing data centers, or that may be something that came from the Schneider design.

I don't think we specified that.

  

[@54:11](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=3251.23) - **Erik Stockglausner**

I haven't checked the latest OCP standards, so I have to look at it. You know, but if it's the one that I recall, that's my memory's not as good as it used to be, obviously, but just wanted to double check that to make sure that is it an absolute requirement or can we deviate from that, if it benefits the efficiency or the CapEx for the data center?

  

[@54:35](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=3275.17) - **David Nocella**

Yeah, if you're able to show, let us know where you found that, can drill down on where it came from and if it's really going to be needed.

But again, you know, we'll defer to you guys. Okay, yeah, so that was our financial consultant. And he might have pulled that off the Schneider one pager.

Schneider. But And thinking I Yeah, got wanted just I'll take a look there as well.

  

[@55:04](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=3304.28) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yeah, my memory of OCP compliance is mostly tied to Facebook, so I'm sure it's gotten broader since then. Okay.

  

[@55:14](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=3314.9) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Cool. And then you're also commissioning a fiber study, if remember, but we wanted to bring up the kind of the route diversity as well as like the idea of getting Google Cloud Platform on ramp, like already set up, because that's such an important thing for you guys being so close to Google.

  

[@55:39](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=3339.0) - **David Nocella**

Yeah, guess we're, are you familiar with David? Yeah. What is the suggestion here, or what are we missing at Google Cloud Platform?

Is that just the ability to kind of integrate with Google Cloud's data, essentially, so that we're utilizing it, or are able to have tenants that are utilizing Google Cloud?

We were integrated into our facility.

  

[@56:08](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=3368.45) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Stock, you want to take the GCP one?

  

[@56:11](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=3371.03) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yeah, I just think if you can get on-ramp, Google OCP on-ramp resolved ahead of time, that's going to be another value add that's going to drive more people to your facility.

I can't remember what Google has in their prior data center, but I'm pretty sure they have a Deschutes implementation there, which might be their AI stuff.

Somebody told me at one point in time we were bidding on a project up there that the intention is that's going to be Google's largest data center in the world at some point.

I just don't know where it's going today.

  

[@56:45](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=3405.63) - **David Nocella**

Is there an action item that we need to do to incorporate this or can we just make an assumption that the project would pursue something like this?

  

[@56:58](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=3418.47) - **Erik Stockglausner**

I think we should probably look into what's required. required. That's Thank Is there an interconnect team?

  

[@57:06](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=3426.36) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

I guess we can take that back if you want.

  

[@57:09](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=3429.76) - **Erik Stockglausner**

If you don't have a telecom consultant, you know, it's something that you might want to consider bringing on and we can bring in that expertise if you need it.

But there's certainly some value there in your network connectivity strategy, including Cloud OnRamp.

  

[@57:25](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=3445.98) - **David Nocella**

Okay. Yeah, let's start if there's any action here. And, you know, with the fiber analysis that Camelot's doing, you know, maybe we can ask this question to them as well.

Do you guys have expertise in-house or is that you guys know some good telecom consultants?

  

[@57:49](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=3469.3) - **Erik Stockglausner**

Yeah, have to, we'd have to, we've got connections to people in our network that do that kind of work.

Like, you don't have to use us. I mean, if you know somebody else, we're happy to work with them.

It's not a big deal. But if... You can't find one because they're all pretty busy right now. I can't promise you we'll be able to find one, but we do have people that do that in our network and it's not like, I don't know that this particular task is going to require a lot of time.

So they might be able say, oh yeah, we can help you with that. Yeah.

  

[@58:18](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=3498.96) - **David Nocella**

I mean, if you could make some suggestions, I think we'd be open to it for sure. I can't watch doing more like physical fiber analysis.

No, they might be perfect for it.

  

[@58:30](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=3510.1) - **Erik Stockglausner**

might be perfect. You might just ask them, say, you guys feel comfortable working with us on, you know, GCP on ramp.

Yeah.

  

[@58:39](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=3519.36) - **David Nocella**

Okay.

  

[@58:40](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=3520.12) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Maybe ask them and if they don't jump at it, then let us know and we can work on the recommendation there.

Okay. I think that's it. Carry me. This is kind of in the weeds. So real quick. I had a couple.

These are not by any final, but I want to go. It's going very slow. Come on. I was just going to say we made it an exact one hour.

  

[@59:16](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=3556.91) - **David Nocella**

You know, that was incredible. Yeah.

  

[@59:20](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=3560.29) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

So we've got some very preliminary renders going on of the exterior shell here. So just kind of clicking through and I mean, there's some topo and we've got, you know, obviously your generators and some batteries and substation zone on zone, which we could potentially move.

  

[@59:42](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=3582.55) - **Erik Stockglausner**

But you guys can say we have some, we have some flexibility if we want to rearrange that configuration, right?

Yeah. Yeah.

  

[@59:49](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=3589.71) - **David Nocella**

Just let us know and we can incorporate it into the overall site design.

What will you know about this big sloth here? So I don't know that that road connects out to the street.

  

[@1:00:01](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=3601.45) - **David Nocella**

no, We're not going to know any time soon, admittedly, this is going to take some effort to even try and get a whole right person within Oklahoma Gas and then trying to start figuring out how to like the easement, yeah, this is going to be a, I honestly don't know when, it's going to be months to get like even really going on.

Fair enough.

  

[@1:00:33](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=3633.96) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Yeah.

  

[@1:00:34](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=3634.94) - **David Nocella**

Have we put any questions out to them yet? Yeah. Yeah.

  

[@1:00:42](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=3642.14) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

Got it. All right. Well, cool. All right. So I, what I'll do is I'll take this meeting, package it up, get you guys the updated version of this memo and this decision log so that it's like cleaned up and you guys can take a few actions.

Um, this call recording should also have, you know, any actions. So I can go through that, so take me a couple, an hour or two, go through all this stuff, get it over to you guys tomorrow or today if I can, and yeah, that should be a good start.

  

[@1:01:14](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=3674.07) - **David Nocella**

Awesome. Yeah.

There's a lot to design here, but yeah. Next meeting? Yeah. Yeah, let's see, I had it on the... That's a good point, I need to do that.

  

[@1:01:33](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=3693.47) - **David Nocella**

I think I have a final meeting on November 5th, but... you go back a week, there is still... There's one on the 30th.

Okay. The 30th? Yeah, let's see if you want to meet in between now and the 30th, because it looks like...

  

[@1:01:49](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=3709.23) - **Benton Peret (benperet@gmail.com)**

I think we had a midpoint on October 20th is what I was planning on next Monday. Did I...? think I scheduled...

Let double check. Perfect. Yeah, haven't scheduled anything until the 30th, right? Yeah.

  

[@1:02:08](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=3728.6) - **David Nocella**

Are you getting what you're looking for? Or is there anything else that we need to be helping you with that we're not?

No, no, I think this is great.

Don't hesitate if there's something that we're missing the boat on or you want more or less information. Sometimes we want to make sure we're not giving you information that's not of interest to you.

But I told Benton and Muhammad, I said, I think we would be foolish not to at least bring up the microgrid thing in light of some of the research we did around demand.

  

[@1:02:55](https://fathom.video/share/8_ukntcz1NJqE7pddkuwhDeRwFRGCrZy?timestamp=3775.26) - **David Nocella**

Absolutely.

Yeah, I've got plenty of other documentation behind this to share if you want to. can tell Some of It's like, you know, GPT generated or cloud code generated.

And so, you know, like it's not 100% baked. So I'm happy to share some of this draft stuff that needs to be validated too, if you guys want to look at some more of it.

For example, like I did a whole analysis on the BESS and UPS work with kind of with Erik and Muhammad's help.

But, you we can obviously go in and we haven't made phone calls and stuff to kind of confirm specific pricing.

But some of that stuff's pretty useful just to give you a good like frame of reference on how to think about it.

Yeah.
