Make sure every single section, every line, is in alignment with our new design as expressed in _BOD. If unsure, flag it.

Let's update the doc to match.

  Furthermore, let's not add more content. I'm actually looknig to reduce the amount of information in this spec by around 30%. I want to make sure we're staying true to the basis of design and not providing too much information.
  Especially information we're not certain about.
