Make sure every single section, every line, is in alignment with our new design as expressed in _BOD. If unsure, flag it.

Let's update the doc to match.

  Furthermore, let's not add more content. I'm actually looknig to reduce the amount of information in this spec by around 30%. I want to make sure we're staying true to the basis of design and not providing too much information.
  Especially information we're not certain about.

## Fire Supression Pricing

Start by reading this to understand the summary of my project as a whole: /Users/bentonperet/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-benperet@gmail.com/My Drive/P3R3T/PGCIS/Saga Obsidian/Saga1/Saga Pryor DC/Basis of Design/_BOD - Exec Summary.md

We will work on pricing for this section of the project - read this: /Users/bentonperet/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-benperet@gmail.com/My Drive/P3R3T/PGCIS/Saga Obsidian/Saga1/Saga Pryor DC/Basis of Design/3BOD - Fire Suppression (CSI Div 21).md

  Please review the spec and then look at the pricing summary. Was the cost table created with broad strokes estimating methods or was it done by bottom-ups pricing from an equipment list?

  What would be the better approach to get the most accurate price at this stage of the process?

## Context
- We will use Phase 4 design details for all pricing. Representing the final state of the data center when estimating equipment counts and pricing.
- This is a long prompt, please save your plan and work into an md file named Financial Working File, and make sure to regularly capture your progress, your next steps and all general information you'll need to pick the effort back up if you are to get interrupted or run out of context.
- Look for ways to parallel process and save context window to get this done efficiently but VERY accurately. Accuracy and attention to detail are CRITICAL.

## Instructions
- 2BOD - Please go line by line and reconfirm the line items in the cost table (and that they match our design - is anything missing or extra?) as well as have the correct numbers / counts / square footage, and the dollar amounts on this table. Also provide a % certainty column - how certain are you about this price. 
- 3BOD - Please go line by line and reconfirm the line items in the cost table (and that they match our design  - is anything missing or extra?) as well as have the correct numbers / counts, and the dollar amounts on this table. Also provide a % certainty column - how certain are you about this price.
- 4BOD - Please go line by line and reconfirm the line items in the equipment table (and that they match our design  - is anything missing or extra?) as well as have the correct numbers / counts. Add a cost table that matches the other, and confirm the dollar amounts on this table with your research. Also provide a % certainty column - how certain are you about this price.
- 5BOD - Please go line by line and reconfirm the line items in the equipment table (and that they match our design  - is anything missing or extra?) as well as have the correct numbers / counts.
