1 | Project Overview

Prepare an investor-grade, decision-quality package in 6 weeks that proves the data center fits the site and demonstrates the project as a sound, investable opportunity. Deliverables will include investor-grade visuals (site plan, renders, conceptual elevations/massing), a defensible Basis of Design (BoD) that supports valuation and capex assumptions, and a one-page risk checklist with prioritized next actions to close technical and commercial gaps. Client is building a ~12 MW solar + battery system on the adjacent land, the BoD will also support the solar-intertie concept and how it reduces operating risk and strengthens the investor case. The package will be timed for immediate use in investor meetings at the end of the six-week engagement. 

  

2 | Scope of Work

The consulting services for this planning year are structured into the following phases, with associated core activities and principal deliverables:

Requirements & Feasibility Memo

Produce a short decision-grade Requirements & Feasibility Memo that documents Equipment preferences and constraints, long-lead alerts, spatial/adjacency needs, KPI targets (PUE band, uptime objective), and “known unknowns” that could change scope or cost (telecom and ops interconnection complexity, floodplain/wetlands, major permitting obstacles). 

This memo is a practical checklist for what must be resolved for investor confidence and for scoping the BoD/BIM work. It will list recommended triggers (e.g., “order switchgear if funding > X or after permit Y”) and immediate owner actions.

Estimated hours (total for this deliverable): BIM Lead 4 hrs; Mechanical Lead 8 hrs; Electrical Lead 8 hrs; Ops Lead 8 hrs.

Target delivery window: Week 1 (initial memo) with final update by Week 2 after intake.

Conceptual Architectural / BIM Package

Deliver a site-specific, investor-grade conceptual architectural and BIM package that proves the building fits the site, quantifies white-space capacity assumptions, and produces the visual assets investors want. 

Principal Deliverables:

- Site plan keyed to the provided CAD / topography (building footprint, battery yard, truck/setdown, staging etc.), 1–2 concept plan views, 2–4 elevations (massing & scale), 1–2 high-quality renders (aerial + approach) for the investor deck, and an IFC model at Level of Design 200 (non-permittable) for handoff. 
    

Includes two review cycles (draft + client feedback + final).

- Final deliverables include PDFs (plans/elevations), PNG/JPEG renders, and IFC files.
    

Estimated hours (total for this deliverable): 

- BIM Lead 60 hrs; Mechanical Lead 20 hrs; Electrical Lead 20 hrs; Ops Lead 10 hrs.
    

Target delivery window: 

- Draft in Week 3, final in Week 6 (with review cycles).
    

Initial Basis of Design

Produce a concise, defensible Basis of Design that takes the existing requirements and converts them into a coherent technical story for investors. The BoD will include: 

- Design intent & objectives (target Tier, maintainability level, and staging strategy)
    
- Architectural concept summary and adjacency rationale
    
- Conceptual electrical architecture (N+1, single-line schematic concepts, how behind-the-meter solar + battery ties in)
    
- Mechanical/cooling strategy (recommended approach, environmental targets, impact on layout)
    
- Telecom/connectivity summary (meet-me-room location, connectivity pull to nearby campus)
    
- Scalability & modularity notes
    
- Constructability callouts and list of missing site data (geotech, topo, interconnection unknowns) that would materially change the design.
    
- Include key diagrams, assumptions table, and an appendix with open items and owner actions.
    
- Two review cycles included.
    

BoD includes a clear list of recommended next steps.

Estimated hours (total for this deliverable): BIM Lead 25 hrs; Mechanical Lead 40 hrs; Electrical Lead 40 hrs; Ops Lead 20 hrs.

Delivery window: Draft in Week 3, final in Week 5-6.
