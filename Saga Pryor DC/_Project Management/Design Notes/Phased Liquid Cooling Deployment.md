**Subject: Recommendation for Phased AI/Liquid Cooling Deployment**

**Executive Summary:** To attract high-density AI clients without over-investing in speculative infrastructure, we recommend a "Liquid Ready" design approach. This strategy involves installing the core mechanical infrastructure during the initial build while deferring the cost of rack-level equipment until a customer contract is secured. This balances capital expenditure with speed-to-market.

**Proposed** "Liquid Ready" Scope **for Day-One Build:**

1. **Full Plant Capacity:** The central Chilled Water Plant (chillers, primary pumps) will be sized to handle the facility's total potential IT load, including the 48 high-density AI racks.
    
2. **Distribution Headers:** The main chilled water supply and return headers will be installed above the designated AI zones in the data hall.
    
3. **Capped Stub-Outs:** Valved and capped connection points ("stub-outs") will be installed on the headers at locations corresponding to future AI rack rows.
    
4. **CDU Infrastructure:** Concrete pads and all necessary power/network conduit for the nine future Coolant Distribution Units (CDUs) will be installed.
    

**Benefits of this Approach:**

- **Reduced Upfront CapEx:** Defers the significant cost of the CDUs and secondary piping.
    
- **Speed-to-Market:** Allows for rapid (weeks, not months) deployment of liquid cooling for new tenants.
    
- **Risk Mitigation:** Avoids all major construction, welding, and core drilling in a live data center environment, protecting existing customer operations.
    

This strategy positions the Saga Energy Pryor facility as a competitive destination for AI workloads while maintaining prudent capital discipline
