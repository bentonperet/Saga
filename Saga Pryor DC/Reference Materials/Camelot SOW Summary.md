**Load Coverage & Reliability Metrics:**
- Based on PV+S (Solar + Storage) performance
- 12x24 heatmap profiles
- Hourly (8760 entries) dispatch and performance results
- Net load calculations based on:
  - Archetypical data center load profiles, or
  - Similar publicly available data

#### Deliverables
- MS Excel pro forma model and/or brief memorandum
- Documentation of relevant methods, assumptions, and results for ease of future transactions by Client

### Task 3. AD HOC SUPPORT

**Budget:** Time & Materials (T&M) - As mutually agreed
**Timeline:** Within three (3) working weeks from task initiation

#### Scope
All meetings and requests that fall outside the defined Scope of Work above may, as mutually agreed, be completed on a time and materials (T&M) basis. Camelot and Client shall mutually agree on scope, receivables, deliverables, timeline, and budget at the time such requests are made.

#### Fiber Design Drawings
Client requested design drawings for drawing fiber to the site. Camelot will complete these drawings on a T&M basis. Client is requested to provide clear expectations so Camelot can complete these drawings as efficiently and effectively as possible.

## Questions for Camelot (To Clarify in Kickoff)

1. **Task 1 - Market Study:**
   - Does "fiber information" include GCP onramp feasibility analysis?
   - Will substation capacity analysis identify specific upgrade costs?

2. **Task 2 - Net Load Analysis:**
   - Can analysis model BESS serving dual purpose (solar storage + UPS function)?
   - Will load coverage metrics help size BESS for reliability without grid power?
   - Can you model generator runtime reduction with solar + BESS?

3. **Task 3 - Ad Hoc:**
   - What level of detail is included in fiber design drawings?
   - Will drawings show diverse route options to Google campus?
   - Estimated hours/cost for fiber design work?
