# Construction Specifications Institute (CSI) MasterFormat

## Overview

The **MasterFormat** is a standard for organizing construction specifications and project manuals developed by the Construction Specifications Institute (CSI) and Construction Specifications Canada (CSC). The current system contains **50 divisions** organized into logical groups.

This reference is used for organizing construction documents, specifications, and cost estimates for the Saga Pryor DC project.
