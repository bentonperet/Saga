# Camelot Scope Clarification - Interconnection Work

## What Camelot IS Doing

**Task 1: Market Study
- Substation hosting capacity analysis
- Transmission line voltage mapping
- Queue position recommendations

**Task 2: Net Load Analysis**
- 8760 hourly load modeling (DC + Solar + BESS)
- Grid interaction profiles
- BESS revenue stack analysis

## What Camelot is NOT Doing

❌ **Formal utility interconnection application with OG&E**
❌ **Interconnection engineering design** (single vs. dual POI)
❌ **Microgrid control system design**
❌ **Direct OG&E coordination**

## Critical Gap
**Saga must separately initiate the formal interconnection request with OG&E.**

Camelot provides the analytical foundation (capacity data, load profiles, queue recommendations), but Saga needs to submit the actual interconnection application using Camelot's data.

---

**Action Required:** Once Camelot delivers their reports (expected end of October), immediately use findings to initiate formal OG&E interconnection request.
